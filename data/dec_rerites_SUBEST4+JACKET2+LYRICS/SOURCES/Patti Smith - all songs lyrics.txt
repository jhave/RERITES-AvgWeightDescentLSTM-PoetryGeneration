 Listen to my story. Got two tales to tell. 
One of fallen glory. One of vanity. 
The world's roof was raging, but we were looking fine; 
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings, 
in Nineteen Fifty Nine. 
 
Wisdom was a teapot; Pouring from above. 
Desolation angels 
Served it up with Love. 
Ignitin'[g strife] like every form of light, 
then moved by bold design, 
slid in that thing and it grew wings, 
in Nineteen Fifty Nine. 
 
It was Blood, shining in the Sun; 
First: Freedom! 
Speeding the american claim: 
Freedom; Freedom; Freedom; Freedom! 
 
China was the tempest; [And] Madness overflowed. 
[The] Lama was a young man, 
and [he] watched his world in flames. 
Taking Glory down by the edge of clouds; 
It was a cryin'[g] shame. 
Another lost horizon. Tibet the fallen star. 
Wisdom and compassion Crushed, in the land of Shangri La. 
But in the land of the Impala, honey, well, 
we were lookin' Fine, 
'cause we built that thing and it grew wings; 
In Nineteen Fifty Nine. 
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings; 
In Nineteen Fifty Nine. 
 
It was the best of times, it's [was] the worst of times; 
In 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959. 
It was the best of times; It was the worst of times. 
[In] Nineteen Fifty Nine.

ABOUT A BOY

 Toward another 
he has gone 
to breathe an air 
beyond his own 
toward a wisdom 
beyond the shelf 
toward a dream 
that dreams itself 
 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
 
from the forest 
from the foam 
from the field 
that he had 
known 
toward a river 
twice as blessed 
toward the inn 
of happiness 
 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
 
from a chaos 
raging sweet 
from the deep 
and dismal street 
toward another 
kind of peace 
toward the great 
emptiness 
 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
about a boy 
beyond it all 
 
[ ] 
I stood among them 
I stood alone 
boy boy 
just a boy 
just a little boy 
[ ] 
just a little boy 
who will never grow

ASK THE ANGELS

 Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling, 
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee 
Ask the angels while they're falling 
Who that person could possibly be 
 
And I know you got the feeling, 
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor 
And I know it got you reelin' 
And honey honey the call is for war 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
 
Everybody got the feelin' 
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day 
Everybody wants to be reelin' 
And baby baby I'll show you the way 
 
And I know it's hard sometimes, 
You got a piece and hit across the sky 
And I know it's hard sometimes 
And world war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
 
Across the country through the fields 
You know I see it written 'cross the sky 
People rising from the highway 
And war war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
 
Armageddon, it's gotten 
No savior jailer can take it from me 
World ending, it's just beginning 
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3 
 
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move 
Comin' in droves in from L.A. 
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove 
Lightning as armor and it's today 
It's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3

BABELOGUE

 I haven't fucked much with the past, but I've fucked plenty with the future. 
Over the skin of silk are scars from the splinters of stations and walls I've caressed. 
A stage is like each bolt of wood, like a log of Helen, is my pleasure. 
I would measure the success of a night by the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed I could exude over the columns that 
nestled the P.A. 
Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off with a skirt of green net sewed over with flat metallic circles which dazzled and 
flashed. 
The lights were violet and white. I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it. 
When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, but now my hair itself is a veil, and the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy and sleepy 
Comanche lies beneath this netting of the skin. 
I wake up. I am lying peacefully I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun. 
I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me. In heart I am a Moslem; in heart I am an American; 
In heart I am Moslem, in heart I'm an American artist, and I have no guilt. 
I seek pleasure. I seek the nerves under your skin. 
The narrow archway; the layers; the scroll of ancient lettuce. 
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, the mole on the belly of an exquisite whore. 
He spared the child and spoiled the rod. I have not sold myself to God.

so touch me now, touch me now, touch me now 
because the night belongs to lovers ... 
 
because tonight there are two lovers 
if we believe in the night we trust 
because tonight there are two lovers ...

BENEATH THE SOUTHERN CROSS

 Oh 
to be 
not anyone 
gone 
this maze of being 
skin 
oh 
to cry 
not any cry 
so mournful that 
the dove just laughs 
the steadfast gasps 
 
oh 
to owe 
not anyone 
nothing 
to be 
not here 
but here 
forsaking 
equatorial bliss 
who walked through 
the callow mist 
dressed in scraps 
who walked 
the curve of the world 
whose bone scraped 
whose flesh unfurled 
who grieves not 
anyone gone 
to greet lame 
the inspired sky 
amazed to stumble 
where gods get lost 
beneath 
the southern cross

BIRDLAND

 His father died and left him a little farm in New England. 
All the long black funeral cars left the scene 
And the boy was just standing there alone 
Looking at the shiny red tractor 
Him and his daddy used to sit inside 
And circle the blue fields and grease the night. 
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars 
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip. 
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm 
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship, 
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it 
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light, 
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board, 
And he was very different tonight 
'Cause he was not human, he was not human. 
 
And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy 
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns, 
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly 
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight, 
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven 
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out, 
 No, daddy, don't leave me here alone, 
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship, 
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it 
Where you're not human, you are not human. 
 
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm. 
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm 
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered 
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet 
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting 
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake 
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck, 
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said, 
 I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up, 
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast, 
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship 
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human. 
 
I am helium raven and this movie is mine, 
So he cried out as he stretched the sky, 
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation ? 
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day 
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in, 
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now, 
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights 
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them, 
And he put up his hands and he said, It's me, it's me, 
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up, 
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up, 
Don't let me here, the son, the sign, the cross, 
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman, 
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons 
No longer presidents but prophets 
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet, 
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation 
It's all gonna split his skull 
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining 
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up 
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer 
Take them up up up up up up 
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up, 
I'm going up, I'm going up 
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there 
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up 
Up, up to the belly of a ship. 
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it 
Where we are not human, we're not human. 
 
Well, there was sand, there were tiles, 
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated 
Like a river of glass 
When it hardened he looked at the surface 
He saw his face 
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals, 
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals 
And he looked up and the rays shot 
And he saw raven comin' in 
And he crawled on his back and he went up 
Up up up up up up 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
We like birdland.

Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it 
Where we are not human, we're not human. 
 
Well, there was sand, there were tiles, 
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated 
Like a river of glass 
When it hardened he looked at the surface 
He saw his face 
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals, 
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals 
And he looked up and the rays shot 
And he saw raven comin' in 
And he crawled on his back and he went up 
Up up up up up up 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, 
We like birdland.

 


BLUE POLES

 Mother as I write the sun dissolves 
Blood life streaming cross my hand 
And these words, these words 
Hope dashed immortal hope 
Hope streaking the canvas sky 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write 
 
We joined the long caravan 
Hungry dreaming going west 
Just for work just to get a job 
And we never got lucky 
We just forged on 
And the dust the endless dust 
Like a plague it covered everything 
Hal fell with the fever 
And mother I did what I could 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write 
 
We prayed we prayed for rain 
I never wanted to see the sun again 
 
All my dresses you made by hand 
We left behind on the road 
Hal died in my arms 
We buried him by the river 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write 
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write

 


BOY CRIED WOLF

 (Smith) 
 
Oh the story's told been told retold 
From the sacred scriptures to the 
tabloids 
All the fuss and fight none above a 
whisper 
The soul of gold the belly of a boy 
 
Well they drew him from the forest 
Like they draw blood 
Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian 
And he turned his head and let the 
arrows fly 
Through the trees, the trees 
The ornamental leaves 
 
Boy cried wolf 
Wolf don't come 
Wolf within 
Boy cried wolf 
 
In the ancient mold they're dancing 
down 
Calling to the moon but it don't answer 
And they fell on their knees 
and passed the bowl around 
And the blood the blood the 
sacramental blood 
 
Boy cried wolf 
Wolf don't come 
Wolf within 
Boy cried wolf 
 
I am the body I am the stream 
I am the wake of everything 
They bring me flowers that are myself 
Garlands of blood that are myself 
Slain the lamb that is himself 
 
Torn reborn the cries of our dismay 
Are nothing to the wind but whose to 
mind 
Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown 
 
Lost received retrieved 
The human tide 
 
Innocence had its day 
Innocence had its day 
Innocence innocence

BREAK IT UP

 Car stopped in a clearing, 
Ribbon of life, it was nearing. 
I saw the boy break out of his skin. 
My heart turned over and I crawled in. 
He cried, Break it up, oh I don't understand, 
Break it up, I can't comprehend. 
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you. 
Break it up, don't talk to me that way, 
I'm not listening. 
 
Snow started falling, 
I could hear the angel calling. 
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings. 
The boy flew away and he started to sing. 
He sang, Break it up, oh, I don't understand. 
Break it up, I can't comprehend. 
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you. 
Break it up, don't look at me. 
 
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared, 
I fell on my knee 
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared. 
I cried, Take me please! 
 
Ice, it was shining. 
I could feel my heart, it was melting. 
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes. 
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through. 
I cried, Break it up, oh, now I understand. 
Break it up, and I want to go. 
Break it up, oh please take me with you. 
Break it up, I can feel it breaking, 
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking, 
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel. 
 
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you. 
Break it up, now I'm gonna go. 
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming. 
Break it up, break it up, break it up, 
Break it up, break it up, break it up, 
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up 
Break it up, break it up, break it on up 
Break it up, break it on up, up, up 
Break it, break it, break it, break it 
Break it on up, break it up, 
Break it up, break it up, break it up ...

 


BROKEN FLAG

 Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground. 
To and fro she's darning, and the land is weeping red and pale. 
Weeping yarn from Algiers. Weeping yarn from Algiers. 
 
Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend. 
The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end. 
For we're marching toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers. 
 
Lullaby tho baby's gone. Lullaby a broken song. 
Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on. 
And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers 
We're still marching for Algiers. Marching, marching for Algiers. 
Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red. 
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed. 
In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms. 
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on.

 


CARTWHEELS

 (Smith/Kaye) 
 
Come my one, look at the world Bird beast butterfly 
Girls sing notes of heaven Birds lift them up to the sky 
 
Spring is departing Spring is departing 
 
Her thoughts are darting like a rabbit Like a rabbit 'cross the moon 
Shines of light over your hair As boys croon 
 
Pretty in pink It makes me wonder 
What could ever bring you down I see tears falling 
From those eyes of brown 
 
Hearing a voice, you turn your head You vanish into the mist 
Of your thoughts And I 
Want to grasp What brings you down 
Open up those eyes of brown 
 
The world is changing Your heart is growing 
 
Hearing a voice you turn your head Girls turn by ones, by twos 
Notes pour bad and tender Eradicate your blues 
 
The good world The good world 
Come my one, look around you Bird, beast, butterfly 
Girls sing notes from heaven Birds lift them up to the sky 
 
I see brown eyes That see girls turning 
Girls turning Cartwheels 
 
The good world The good whirl 
The good world The good whirl 
 
Come my one, look at your world Don't let it bring you down 
Come on open for me Those eyes of brown 
 
I see girls turning Cartwheels 
Cartwheels Cartwheels...

 


CASH

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
Here we go around again Curve of life spiraling 
Everything we've ever known As the seed of life gets blown 
And the miracle of time When will that time just end 
Remember, you decide Take that vow 
Grab that ring It's not a whim 
Not a whim When you be cashing in 
 
Try to turn your life around And all the things you do resound 
And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then 
Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends 
Where that time begins Remember, you decide 
Take that vow Take a stand 
Grab that ring It's not a whim 
It's not a whim It's only time 
That you're cashing in 
 
In the white noise of desire We can't hear a single thing 
Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul 
Its beauty immaterial 
 
You decide Stand along 
The fallen ones Take revenge 
Defeated sons Rend that coat 
From seam to seam It's only time 
It's only time That you spend 
You spend It's only time 
You spend Its only time 
You spend It's only life 
That you're cashing in

 


CHINA BIRD

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
One fine day these words I pray 
Will breathe a truth 
Within yourself upon a shelf 
A life anew 
So many roads 
It's hard to know what to do 
All your dreams 
All it seems 
Is as you choose 
For destiny my china bird 
Is calling for you 
 
The world turns 
The flame burns 
Bright and true 
Near and far 
Where you are 
Guiding you china bird 
The open skies 
Are yearning for you 
 
If they say it's not that way 
Hold your view 
With my love fly above 
A light anew 
Oh spread your wings 
The open sky 
Is calling to you china bird 
My heart is yearning for you 
 
If you fly away 
I'll be waiting come what may 
All my love a fragile ray 
For you for you

 


CITIZEN SHIP

 I was nothing. It didn't matter to me. 
Ah, there were tags all over my sleeve. 
There was water outside the windows 
and children in the streets [ ] rats with tags. 
 
Ain't got a passport. 
Ain't got my real name. 
Ain't got a chance, sport, at fortune and fame. 
And I walk these endless streets, won't you give me a lift. 
A lift. A lift. On your citizen ship. 
 
They were rioting in Chicago, movement in L.A. 
Sixty eight it broke up the yardbirds. 
We were broke as well. 
Took it underground, M.C. borderline, up against the wall. 
The wall. The wall. 
Show your papers, boy. 
 
Citizen ship we got mem'ries. 
Stateless, they got shame. 
Cast adrift from the citizen ship, 
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway. 
 
Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace. 
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste. 
Men in uniform gave me vinegar, spoon of misery. 
But what the hell, I fell, I fell. 
It doesn't matter to me. 
 
Citizen ship we got mem'ries 
Citizen ship, we got pain. 
Cast adrift from the citizen ship, 
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway. 
 
I was caught like a moth with its wings outta sync. 
Cut the chord. Overboard. Just a refugee. 
Lady liberty, lend a hand to me, I've been cast adrift. 
Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. 
 
On the citizen ship we got mem'ries 
Citizen ship, we got pain. 
Lose your grip on the citizen ship, 
you're cast, you're cast away. 
On the citizen ship you got mem'ry. 
Citizen ship you got pain. 
Citizen ship you got identity. 
A name. A name. A name. . . 
 
What's your name, son? 
What's your name? . . . 
What's your name? 
[ ] 
Nothing. I got nothing. 
[ ] Jersey. 
Give me your tired, your poor 
Give me your huddled masses 
your wartorn [ ] 
Give me your wartorn and your [ ] 
Lift up your [ ] unto me. 
Ah, mythology.

 


COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA

 Come back little Sheba 
I hear them calling 
Open your ears 
Awake from thy sleep 
High above 
The stars are falling 
Open your arms 
And you shall receive 
 
The lights of the city 
So bold and flashing 
All of its riches 
Imparted to thee 
Robes of saffron 
Robes of standing 
A road of crimson 
Spread at your feet 
 
Your robes of standing 
Your robes of saffron 
Your road of crimson 
All pleasing to me 
But close your lights 
Close your gates 
I must arise 
My flock awaits 
 
Farewell little Sheba 
I hear them a'calling 
Here is your staff 
Tend to thy sheep 
Good wishes be with you 
If that be your calling 
Farewell little Sheba 
Arise and take leave

 


DANCING BAREFOOT

 she is benediction 
she is addicted to thee 
she is the root connection 
she is connecting with he 
 
here I go and I don't know why 
I fell so ceaselessly 
could it be he's taking over me... 
 
I'm dancing barefoot 
heading for a spin 
some strange music draws me in 
makes me come on like some heroin/e 
 
she is sublimation 
she is the essence of thee 
she is concentrating on 
he, who is chosen by she 
 
here I go and I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly, 
could it be he's taking over me... 
 
[chorus] 
 
she is re creation 
she, intoxicated by thee 
she has the slow sensation that 
he is levitating with she ... 
 
here I go and I don't know why, 
I spin so ceaselessly, 
'til I lose my sense of gravity... 
 
[chorus] 
 
(oh god I fell for you ...) 
 
the plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face 
the mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself 
grave visitations 
what is it that calls to us? 
why must we pray screaming? 
why must not death be redefined? 
we shut our eyes we stretch out our arms 
and whirl on a pane of glass 
an afixiation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree 
the hands of he and the promise that s/he is blessed among women. 
 
(oh god I fell for you ...)

DEAD CITY

 This dead city longs to be 
This dead city longs to be free 
Seven screaming horses 
Melt down in the sun 
Building scenes on empty dreams 
And smoking them one by one 
 
This dead city longs to be 
This dead city longs to be living 
Is it any wonder there's squalor in the sun 
With their broken schemes and their lotteries 
They never get nowhere 
 
Is it any wonder they're spitting at the sun 
God's parasites in abandoned sites 
and they never have much fun 
 
If I was a blind man 
Would you see for me 
Or would you confuse 
The nature of my blues 
And refuse a hand to me 
 
Is it any wonder crying in the sun 
Is it any wonder I'm crying in the sun 
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes 
Now I'm burning them one by one 
 
This damn city this dead city 
Immortal city 
Motor city 
Suc cess city 
Longs to be 
Longs to be 
Free 
Free 
Free

DEAD TO THE WORLD

 Dead to the world my body was sleeping 
on my mind was nothing at all 
come a mist an aire so appealing 
I'm here a whispering you summouned I called 
 
I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing 
oh he would shift he would not shift at all 
we sat for a while he was very engaging 
and when he was gone I was gone on a smile 
 
With a strange way of walking 
and a strange way of breathing 
more lives than a cat 
that let me astray 
all in all he captured my heart 
dead to the world and just 
slipped away 
 
I heard me a music that drew me to dancing 
lo I turned under his spell 
I opened my coat but he never came closer 
I bolted the door and whispered oh well 
 
With a strange way of walking 
and a strange way of breathing 
more lives than a cat 
that let me astray 
all in all he captured my heart 
dead to the world and just 
slipped away 
 
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me 
wondering well I just couldn't discern 
will he come back come back to me 
oh I whispered will you ever return 
 
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary 
he was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke 
the life in his fingers unwound my existence 
dead to the world alive I awoke 
 
With a strange way of walking 
and a strange way of breathing 
less than a breath of shimmer and smoke 
the life in his fingers unwound my existence 
dead to the world alive I awoke 
alive I awoke 
alive alive I awoke 
alive I awoke 
alive I awoke 
alive 
I awoke 
I awoke 
alive I awoke 
alive alive o 
alive alive o

 


DEATH SINGING

 In the straw colored light 
In light rapidly changing 
On a life rapidly fading 
 
Have you seen death singing 
Have you seen death singing 
 
With a throat smooth as a lamb 
Yet dry as a branch not snapping 
He throws back his head 
And he does not sing a thing mournful 
 
Have you seen death singing 
Have you seen death singing 
Have you seen death singing 
In the straw colored light 
 
He sings a black embrade 
And white opals swimming 
In a child's leather purse 
Have you seen death swimming 
Have you seen death swimming 
 
With a throat smooth as a lamb 
Yet dry as a branch not snapping 
He throws back his head 
And he does not sing a thing mournful 
 
Have you seen death singing 
Have you seen death singing 
Have you seen death singing 
In the straw colored light 
 
He sings of youth enraged 
And the burning of Atlanta 
And these viral times 
And May ribbons streaming 
And straw colored curls a turning 
A mother's vain delight 
And woe to the sun 
And woe to the young 
Another hearse is drawn 
Have you seen death singing 
In the straw colored light

 


DISTANT FINGERS

 When, when will you be landing? 
When, when will you return?

Deep inside of your ship.

DON'T SAY NOTHING

 Lower the thing the skin of a cat 
Skin it to the left just laying there 
No other thing is luck like that 
And you set it said it said nothing 
 
Went to the party very discouraged 
I watched the litter pile like a wall 
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it 
It was ladened with all kinds of shit 
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing 
I turned my back walked away 
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing 
 
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner 
I was listening they were saying this and saying that 
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered 
Nothing good was coming I just stood there 
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing 
I walked the floor then I looked away 
 
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing 
 
How long how long will we make do 
Maybe it's time to break on through 
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up 
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something 
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back 
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue 
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card 
Well I'm gonna do something 
Oh my brain I got to complain 
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something 
How long how long will we make do 
Maybe it's time to break on through 
 
Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned 
I saw it floating in the river 
I saw and no one seemed to mind 
They sat there they sat there watching the sun 
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble 
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun 
Spread its wings and fly away 
And in the mountains a cry echoes 
Don't say nothing 
Don't say nothing no 
Don't say nothing no

 


DREAM OF LIFE

 Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
 
I'm with you always 
You're ever on my mind 
In a light to last a whole life through 
Each way I turn 
the sense of you surrounds 
in every step I take 
In all I do 
Your thoughts your schemes 
captivate my dreams 
Everlasting, ever new 
 
Sea returns to sea 
And sky to sky 
In a life of dream am I 
When I'm with you 
 
Deep in my heart 
How the presence of you shines 
In a light to last a whole life through 
I recall the wonder of it all 
Each dream of life I'll share with you 
 
Sea returns to sea 
And sky to sky 
In a life of dream am I 
When I'm with you 
 
I'm with you always 
You're ever on my mind 
In a light to last a whole life through 
The hand above 
turns those leaves of love 
All and all a timeless view 
Each dream of life 
Flung from paradise 
Everlasting, ever new 
 
Dream of Life 
Dream Of Life 
 
Na na na na na

 


EASTER

 Easter Sunday, we were walking. 
Easter Sunday, we were talking. 
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come. 
 
Isabella, all is glowing. 
Isabella, all is knowing. 
And my heart, Isabella. 
And my head, Isabella. 
 
Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee. 
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come. 
 
Isabella, all is glowing. 
Isabella, all is knowing. 
Isabella, we are dying. 
Isabella, we are rising. 
 
I am the spring, the holy ground, 
the endless seed of mystery, 
the thorn, the veil, the face of grace, 
the brazen image, the thief of sleep, 
the ambassador of dreams, the prince of peace. 
I am the sword, the wound, the stain. 
Scorned transfigured child of Cain. 
I rend, I end, I return. 
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh. 
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star, 
the ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ 
dying and drying as I rise tonight. 
 
Isabella, we are rising. 
Isabella, we are rising . . .

 


ELEGIE

 I just don't know what to do tonight, 
My head is aching as I drink and breathe 
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own. 
 
There must be something I can dream tonight, 
The air is filled with the moves of you, 
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah. 
 
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance 
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad 
That our friends can't be with us today.

 


FAREWELL REEL

 It's been a hard time 
and when it rains 
it rains on me 
the sky just opens 
and when it rains 
it pours 
 
I walk alone 
assaulted it seems 
by tears from heaven 
and darling I can't help 
thinking those tears are yours 
 
Our wild love came from above 
and wilder still 
is the wind that howls 
like a voice that knows it's gone 
cause darling you died 
and well I cried 
but I'll get by 
salute our love 
and send you a smile 
and move on 
 
So darling farewell 
all will be well 
and then all will be fine 
the children will rise 
strong and happy be sure 
cause your love flows 
and the corn still grows 
and God only knows 
we're only given 
as much as the heart can endure 
 
But I don't know why 
but when it rains 
it rains on me 
the sky just opens 
and when it rains 
it pours 
 
But I look up 
and a rainbow appears 
like a smile from heaven 
and darling I can't 
help thinking that smile 
is yours

GANDHI

 (Smith/Kaye/Ray/Shanahan/Daugherty) 
 
I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon 
I was trespassing A sacred garden 
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy 
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi 
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi 
 
When he was a boy He was afraid of the dark 
His mother would fast And pray at his feet 
And the lamp burned as he slept Slept as he dreamed 
He was dreaming of his sisters Dressed in white muslin 
Dressed in white muslin Dancing in a ring 
He was afraid of the dark And the lamp burned 
And his mother fasted And prayed as he slept 
Dreaming of blossoms They were burning his throat 
He had eaten flowers Fell burning 
Flowers fell burning From the young girls' hair 
He was whispering Into his god's ear 
Let the children be so Let the children be so 
And the lamplight flickered flickered And his mother withered like Job 
And he lay there dreaming And the blossoms fell 
And Tilak's trumpet Proceeded to call 
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy 
And the people cried Gandhi Gandhi... 
 
I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon 
I was trespassing The sacred garden 
And the blossoms fell Well, they dropped like candy 
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi 
 
Hey little man Awake from your slumber 
Get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers 
 
He was frail and shy And the cast of his mind 
Was mercurial Was mercurial 
As the sacred verbs Scrawled 
In the dust On the floor 
On the floor Long live revolution 
And the spinning wheel And a handful of salt 
And a handful of salt The untouchables 
Dropped like candy They called to him 
Gandhi Gandhi The children of god 
With hands full of candy They called to him 
Gandhi Gandhi Feel our woes 
Man of the giving Rejoin the living 
Rejoin the living Awake from the net 
Where you've been sleeping And their climbing climbing 
The flowing hair And the golden flowers 
Of the young girls Well they dropped all around 
They dropped like candy And people cried 
Gandhi Gandhi Awake little man 
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers 
Get 'em with the numbers 
 
One Two Three Four hundred 
Thousand million people 
People People... 
 
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber 
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers 
Get 'em with the numbers Long live revolution 
And the spinning wheel Awake awake 
Is the mighty appeal Oh, people awake 
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers 
Get 'em with the numbers 
 
I had a dream Mr. King 
If you'll beg my pardon I was trespassing 
The sacred garden And the blossoms fell 
Dropped like candy And nature called 
Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi 
 
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber 
And get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers

 


GHOST DANCE

 We shall live again, we shall live. 
 
What is it children that falls from the sky ? 
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye aye. 
Mannah from Heaven from the most high, 
Food from the father, tayi, taye aye. 
 
We shall live again, we shall live again, 
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance. 
 
Peace to your brother, give and take peace, 
Tayi, taya, it leaves two feet 
One foot extended, snake to the ground, 
Wave up the Earth, one turn around. 
 
We shall live again, we shall live again, 
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance. 
 
Stretch out your arms now tip and swing, 
Rude up thy bird, tayi, tayi. 
Threw out your shoe over the soil, 
Dust off the words that shaped from the tale. 
 
We shall live again, we shall live again, 
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance. 
 
Here we are, Father, Lord, Holy Ghost, 
Bread of your bread, ghost of your host, 
We are the tears that fall from your eyes, 
Word of your word, cry of your cry. 
 
We shall live again, we shall live again, 
We shall live again. 
 
What is it, Father, in your eye, 
What is this wisdom, eyes of God, 
That makes me feel just what I need. 
You used to fly me the way to speed. 
 
What is it, Father, holy that night ? 
What is it, Father, that moves to the right ? 
What is it, Father, that is waiting in Heaven ? 
What is it, Father, that shapes from your hand ? 
What is it, Father, that makes me spin around ? 
What is it, Father, that brings me down 
What is it, Father, you can't tell what I like. 
What is it, Father, I just ride into space 
What is it, Father, I can tell you one night 
What is it, Father, I can tell what I like 
What is it, Father, are you into shape 
What is it, Father, are you calling today 
What is it, Father ... [ ]

GLITTER IN THEIR EYES

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
It's been a while since I've seen your 
face 
It's been a while since I've walked this 
place 
I see the monkeys riding on their bikes 
Racing through the impossible night 
 
You say you're feeling like a new tree 
Man they'll cut you from limb to limb 
Pick your pocket with such delight 
Shake it to the right 
Shake it in the light 
 
Oh can't you see the glitter 
The glitter in their eyes 
Oh can't you see the glitter 
The glitter in their eyes 
 
Genius stalking in new shoes 
Have you got WTO blues 
Dust of diamonds 
Making you sneeze 
Kids on rollers ready for 
Running through the junkyards 
Breezing through the halls 
Racing through the malls 
Walking through the walls 
They'll strip your mind 
Just for fun 
Quoth the raven 
Yum yum yum 
 
Children children everywhere 
Selling souls for souvenirs 
They've been sold out like as not 
Just for chunks of Ankgor Vat 
 
They'll trade you up 
Trade you down 
Your body a commodity 
Our sacred stage 
Has been defaced 
Replaced to grace 
The marketplace 
Dow is jonesing at the bit 
42nd Disney Street 
Ragged hearts unraveling 
Look out kids 
The gleam the gleam 
All that glitters 
Is not all that glitters 
Is not all that glitters

and I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine 
make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine 
 
G L O R I A Gloria G L O R I A Gloria G L O R I A Gloria, 
G L O R I A Gloria 
 
and the tower bells chime, ding dong they chime 
they're singing, Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.

GOING UNDER

 Sun is rising on the water 
Light is dancing again 
Let's go under where the sun beams 
Let's go under my friend 
 
Are we sleeping 
Are we dreaming 
Are we dancing again 
Is it heaven 
Crack it open 
and we'll slide down 
its stream 
 
We can hold on (I'm sure) 
To the sea's foaming mane 
It will serve us 
We'll surface 
and we'll plunge back again 
 
Sun is rising on the water 
Light is dancing like a flame 
There's no burning where the sun beams 
Oh it's such a lovely game 
 
Does the sea dream (I'm sure) 
We are here, we attend 
We are bells on the shore 
where the tolling suspends 
 
Who will decide the shape of things 
The shift of being 
Who will perceive 
When life is new 
Shall we divide and become another 
Who is due for gift upon gift 
Who will decide 
Shall we swim over and over 
The curve of a wing 
Its destination ever changing 
 
Sun is rising on the water 
Light is dancing like a flame 
Let's go waltzing on the water 
Let's go under again 
 
Let's go under 
Going under

 


GONE AGAIN

 Hey now man's own kin 
we commend into the wind 
grateful arms grateful limbs 
grateful soul he's gone again 
 
I have a winter's tale 
how vagrant hearts relent prevail 
sow their seed into the wind 
seize the sky and they're gone again 
 
fame is fleeting God is nigh 
we raise our arms to him on night 
we shoot our flint into the sun 
we bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone 
 
Hey now man's own kin 
we commend into the wind 
grateful arms grateful limbs 
grateful heart he's gone again 
 
Here a man man's own kin 
he turned his back and his own people shot him 
and he fell on his knees 
before the burning plane 
and he beheld fields of gold his land his sun 
and he arose his blood aflame 
the clouds pressed with hand prints stained 
 
one last breath 
the sky is high 
the hungry earth 
the empty vein 
the ashes rain 
death's own bed 
man's own kin 
into the wind 
one last breath 
hole in life 
love knot tied 
braid undone 
child born 
the hollow horn 
warrior cried 
a warrior died 
one last breath 
lick of flame 
spirit moaned 
spirit shed 
the heavens fed 
man's own kin 
grips the sky 
and he's gone again 
 
Hey now man's own kin 
we lay down into the wind 
grateful arms grateful limbs 
grateful heart he's gone again 
 
Hey now man's own kin 
he ascends into the wind 
grateful heart grateful limbs 
grateful man he's gone again

GONE PIE

 (Smith/Shanahan) 
 
Hey there 
Come and take a walk with me 
Stroll into infinity 
We'll stroll along 
Until the dawn is gone 
Midnight take it to the twilight 
Just a little slice of light 
Let's turn it off and on off and on 
 
Strolling ain't it wonderful 
Into a light that lingers 
On and on, on and on 
 
Strolling ain't it wonderful 
Stars fall for we two 
Bathed in a light of our own 
 
Oh life 
Much too great to sacrifice 
Come and have another slice 
Ah life goes on and on 
Oh life 
May you live a long life 
May you live a long life 
May you live a long life

 


GRATEFUL

 (Smith) 
 
Ours is just another skin 
That simply slips away 
You can rise above it 
It will shed easily 
 
It all will come out fine 
I've learned it line by line 
One common wire 
One silver thread 
All that you desire 
Rolls on ahead 
 
Like a ship in a bottle 
Held up to the sun 
Sails ain't going nowhere 
You can count every one 
Until it crashes unto the 
earth 
And simply slips away 
You can hide in the open 
Or just disappear 
 
Ours is just a craving 
And a twist of the wrist 
Will undo the stopper 
With abrupt tenderness 
Die little sparrow 
And awake 
Singing 
 
It all will come out fine 
I've learned it line by line 
One common wire 
One silver thread 
All that you desire 
Rolls on ahead

 


GUNG HO

 (Smith/Ray/Kaye/Shanahan/Daugherty) 
 
On a field of red one gold star 
Raised above his head 
Raised above his head 
He was not like any other 
He was just like any other 
And the song they bled 
Was a hymn to him 
 
Awake my little one 
The seed of revolution 
Sewn in the sleeve 
Of cloth humbly worn 
Where others are adorned 
 
Above the northern plain 
The great birds fly 
With great wings 
Over the paddy fields 
And the people kneel 
And the men they toil 
Yet not for their own 
And the children are hungry 
And the wheel groans 
 
There before a grass hut 
A young boy stood 
His mother lay dead 
His sisters cried for bread 
And within his young heart 
The seed of revolution sewn 
In cloth humbly worn 
While others are adorned 
 
And he grew into a man 
Not like any other 
Just like any other 
One small man 
A beard the color of rice 
A face the color of tea 
Who shared the misery 
Of other men in chains 
With shackles on his feet 
Escaped the guillotine 
 
Who fought against 
Colonialism imperialism 
Who remained awake 
While others slept 
Who penned like Jefferson 
Let independence ring 
And the cart of justice turns 
Slow and bitterly 
And the people were crying 
Plant that seed that seed 
And they crawled on their bellies 
Beneath the giant beast 
And filled the carts with bodies 
Where once had been their crops 
 
And the great birds swarm 
Spread their wings overhead 
And his mother dead 
And the typhoons and the rain 
The jungles in flames 
And the orange sun 
None could be more beautiful 
Than Vietnam 
Nothing was more beautiful 
Than Vietnam 
 
And his heart stopped beating 
And the wheel kept turning 
And the words he bled 
Were a hymn to them 
I have served the whole people 
I have served my whole country 
And as I leave this world 
May you suffer union 
And my great affection 
Limitless as sky 
Filled with golden stars 
 
The question is raised 
Raised above his head 
Was he of his word 
Was he a good man 
For his image fills the southern heart 
With none but bitterness 
 
And the people keep crying 
And the men keep dying 
And it's so beautiful 
So beautiful 
Give me one more turn 
Give me one more turn 
One more turn of the wheel 
 
One more revolution 
One more turn of the wheel

 


HIGHER LEARNING

 

 


HYMN

 When I am troubled in the night he comes to comfort me. 
He wills me thru the darkness and the empty child is free to take his hand his sacred heart the heart that breaks the dawn. 
Amen. And when I think I've had my fill he fills up again.

 


JUBILEE

 (Smith/Kaye/Daugherty) 
 
Oh glad day to celebrate 'Neath the cloudless sky 
Air so sweet Water pure 
Fields ripe with rye Come one, come all 
Gather round Discard your Sunday shoes 
Come on now Oh my land 
Be a jubilee Come on girl 
Come on boy Be a jubilee 
 
Oh my land Oh my good 
People don't be shy Weave the birth of harmony 
With children's happy cries Hand in hand 
We're dancing around In a freedom ring 
Come on now Oh my land 
Be a jubilee Come on girl 
Come on boy Be a jubilee 
 
We will never fade away Doves shall multiply 
Yet I see hawks circling the sky Scattering our glad day 
With debt and despair What good hour 
Will restore our troubled air? Come on people 
Gather round You know what to do 
Come on people Oh my land 
What be troubling Oh my land 
What be troubling What be troubling 
What be troubling you 
 
We are love and the future We stand in the midst of fury and weariness 
Who dreams of joy and radiance? Who dreams of war and sacrifice? 
Our sacred realms are being squeezed Curtailing civil liberties 
Recruit the dreams that sing to thee Let freedom ring 
 
Freedom ring Freedom ring 
Jubilee Oh my land 
Oh glad day Oh my land 
Hear our cry Freedom ring 
Oh glad day Oh my land 
Jubilee Jubilee

 


KIMBERLY

 The wall is high, the black barn, 
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes 
And I know soon that the sky will split 
And the planets will shift, 
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop. 
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind. 
Little sister, the fates are calling on you. 
 
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind, 
The sea rushes up my knees like flame 
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc 
And the cause is you lookin' up at me. 
Oh baby, I remember when you were born, 
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly 
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas 
And I lit a match and the void went flash 
And the sky split and the planets hit, 
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop. 
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind. 
Little sister, the fates are calling on you. 
 
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you, 
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you. 
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane, 
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces 
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky, 
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me. 
Your soul was like a network of spittle, 
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic, 
And I prayed as the lightning attacked 
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack, 
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack. 
 
The palm trees fall into the sea, 
It doesn't matter much to me 
As long as you're safe, Kimberly. 
And I can gaze deep 
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, 
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, 
Into your starry eyes, oh. 
 
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby, 
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh. 
 
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby, 
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby

 


LAND

 The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea 
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating 
Another boy was sliding up the hallway 
He merged perfectly with the hallway, 
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway 
 
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run, 
but the movie kept moving as planned 
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker, 
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny 
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees, 
started crashing his head against the locker, 
started crashing his head against the locker, 
started laughing hysterically 
 
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by 
horses, horses, horses, horses 
coming in in all directions 
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames, 
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses. 
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney 
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this 
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator 
And you twist the twister like your baby sister 
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister 
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee, 
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control, 
Got to lose control and then you take control, 
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that, 
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that, 
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi 
 
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin 
Angel looks down at him and says, Oh, pretty boy, 
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ? 
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket, 
Taped to his chest there's the answer, 
You got pen knives and jack knives and 
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred 
Then he cries, then he screams, saying 
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain 
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud, 
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud, 
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi 
 
There's a little place, a place called space 
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks, 
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that, 
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that, 
And the name of the band is the 
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, 
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes 
 
Baby calm down, better calm down, 
In the night, in the eye of the forest 
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair, 
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair, 
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that 
up there there is a sea 
up there there is a sea 
up there there is a sea 
the sea's the possibility 
There is no land but the land 
(up there is just a sea of possibilities) 
There is no sea but the sea 
(up there is a wall of possibilities) 
There is no keeper but the key 
(up there there are several walls of possibilities) 
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities. 
(up there) 
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me 
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor 
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee 
(on the screen) 
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame 
(in the heart of man) 
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions 
Gradually lapping into sea horses 
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat 
(the spoon) 
And let it deep in 
(the veins) 
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities 
It started hardening 
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities 
It started hardening in my hand 
And I felt the arrows of desire 
 
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac amour 
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area 
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud) 
And go Johnny go and do the watusi, 
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ... 
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling 
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining 
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse 
And my fingers all entwined through the air, 
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers, 
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it) 
The hairs were like wires going through my body 
I I that's how I 
that's how I 
I died 
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after) 
(they knew what they were after) 
[Everything on the current] moved up 
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth, 
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility 
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities 
There's no land but the land 
 
looked at my hands, and there's a red stream 
that went streaming through the sands like fingers, 
like arteries, like fingers 
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?) 
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes) 
He opened his throat (your eyes) 
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands 
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard, 
No one heard that cry, 
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat, 
(His fingers) 
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly, 
And so he seized the first 
(his vocal chords shot up) 
(possibility) 
(like mad pituitary glands) 
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate 
(there is nothing happening at all) 
and go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep 
saw this sweet young thing (Fender one) 
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter 
 
In the sheets 
there was a man 
dancing around 
to the simple 
Rock & roll 
song

 


LAST CALL

 In a mansion high the young man stood 
Ready to join his companions good 
Outside the scent of magnolia blossoms 
Down streets of gold the children were racing 
 
Just another wandering soul 
Adrift among the stars 
Just another human heart 
Led, led away 
 
He put his shoes on and he laid down 
Outside the clouds were swiftly gathering 
He drained his cup and his stirred the mixture 
And he closed his eyes as his conscience whispered 
 
Just another wandering soul 
Adrift among the stars 
Just another human heart 
Led, led away 
 
Misgivings unspoken he joined his companions 
His face covered over in a mansion high 
Outside the children gazed in wonder 
At the quickening sky then slowly disbanded 
 
Thirty nine wandering souls 
Adrift among the stars 
Thirty nine human hearts 
Led, led away 
 
His burning skin cooled by angels 
Swallowing sorrows excretion 
It's all excretion 
Felled by his hand of the mind of another man 
Who makes the decisions 
Lends no provisions for mere eternal rides 
Learning of course every alien force 
 
Even Christ yearns to be 
To possess the skin 
And bone the blood of man 
Who tends the flock who breaks the bread 
Who makes his own choices 
Won't listen to voices 
Accept no false teachers 
False preachers, good deeders 
With their hands out stretched 
To be filled with your money 
Your mind, your heart, your imagination 
Sympathy, empathy 
Acknowledge all man as fellow creation 
But don't follow him 
Don't be led away

 


LIBBIE'S SONG

 (Smith) 
 
If it wasn't for your golden hair 
I would not be belonely 
If it wasn't for your golden hair 
I would not be alone 
 
If it wasn't for your piercing stare 
I would not be belonely 
If it wasn't for your piercing stare 
I would not be alone 
 
I would not waltz in a widow's line 
What was yours would not be mine 
If it wasn't for your golden hair 
I would not be alone 
 
You courted me with princely airs 
Said you'd love me only 
Kiss the ribbons in my hair 
Said darling come and fly 
 
Flower of the Calvary 
You swept me off my saddle 
Lifted me into your life 
A soldier's wife was I 
 
You marched proudly for the horn 
I prayed for your swift return 
I waited for you so forlorn 
'Ere to be alone 
I longed for you, I longed to die 
I was so belonely 
The pillow's bare by my side 
And yet I shall abide 
 
For heaven has aset for me 
Companion for eternity 
So kiss the ribbons in my hair 
Say darling come and fly 
 
If it wasn't for your golden hair 
I would not be alonely 
If it wasn't for your golden hair

 


LO AND BEHOLDEN

 (Smith/Kaye) 
 
I was alone and content in my world 
Dancing on air 
You sent to me a message that said 
I like your style 
Will you come to the temple tonight 
And dance for me there 
I pledge to you all that you wish 
The moon and the stars 
 
Lo and beholden 
Why don't you give it up 
Lo and beholden Come on you know 
it's true 
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you 
 
In the palace there was wild reverie 
And the look in your eyes 
As I dropped veil after veil 
Was drunken desire 
The dove calls and God notes it all 
The naked truth 
Here is my veil the seventh and last 
It will cost you 
 
Lo and beholden 
Why don't you give it up 
Lo and beholden 
Come on you know it's true 
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you 
 
The royal word has passed 
The prophet's head is all I ask 
For beauty and the naked truth 
It will cost you 
 
Lo and beholden 
Why don't you give it up 
Lo and beholden 
Come on you know it's true 
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you

 


LOOKING FOR YOU (I WAS)

 In the medieval night 
'Twas love's design 
And the sky was open 
like a Valentine 
All the lacy lights 
Where wishes fall 
And like Shakespeare's child 
I wished on them all 
 
Ahh to be your destiny 
was all that I pursued 
I could see the sights 
from the lofty heights 
But my heart obscured the view 
 
I was looking for you 
Looking for you 
What could I do 
I was looking for you 
 
Along the black river 
The ambassador jewels 
And you were reflected 
in all that I saw 
In the towers of gold 
In the wheel and wing 
Gripping my senses 
like an ancient claim 
 
Many is the time I knelt in the light 
appealing to all that I know 
Guide my eyes and steps 
that I may find love true 
 
Refrain 
 
Come on darlin' 
All that hearts desire 
was written before us 
In the medieval fire 
It was love's design 
In the glittering stars 
Like Shakespeare's child 
To be where you are 
 
From the Portobello Road 
To the Port of Marseilles 
Where the dervish turns 
Where the wild goats play 
 
Looking for you 
I was

 


MEMENTO MORI

 the fans were whirlin' 
like the blades of a 'copter 
liftin' into the skies above some foreign land 
soaked with the bodies of so many friends. 
 
Johnny waved 
he was on his way home 
he waved goodbye to his comrades in arms, 
and all the twisted things he'd seen. 
he waved goodbye 
and the blades hit 
something 
maybe just Fate, but the blades hit 
the 'copter went up in flames 
and Johnny never went marchin' home 
Johnny never went marchin' home 
 
they took his name 
and they carved it on a slab of marble 
with several thousand other names 
all the fallen idols 
the apples of their mother's eye 
just another name 
 
meanwhile 
back on that burning shore 
Johnny's comrades stood speechless 
they looked with uh uh uh uh disbelieving eyes 
as those bits of metal and the embers 
the embers of his eyes 
fanned out into the air 
black dust 
flames 
 
oh Johnny! some day they'll make a movie about you 
and in the making of that movie 
some mad apocalypse 
it will become even stranger than the simple act 
just a boy going up up up 
just a boy going up 
in flames in the smoke 
just another life 
just another breath 
and who'll remember 
oh eternity now 
as eternal as a sheet of marble 
eternal as a slab on a green hill 
and your name 
and all your fallen brothers 
and all the ones not cut 
all the ones remembered only in the hearts 
a mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter 
shall not shall not fade shall not fade 
 
your ancestors salute you 
and the gods of your ancestors salute you 
having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors 
the gods of your ancestors salute you 
having been formed by your ancestors 
the gods of your ancestors salute you 
they draw you in they draw you through 
they draw they draw you through that golden door 
 
mornin' boy [come on in boy] 
we remember you 
we conceived of you 
we conceived of your breath 
we conceived of the whole human race 
and we conceived it to be a beautiful thing 
like a tulip bending in the wind 
sometimes it comes back to us 
in the form of a handful of dust 
comes back in the form of a smitten child 
our raped daughters, ah the broken bones 
souls cleaved from hearts 
they come back to us 
and our hands are filled with their rotting tissues 
but we turn not our backs 
we press our lips 
into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one 
and that love is there and will greet you, will greet you 
mornin' boy [come on in boy] 
it's eternal love 
 
well here, go ahead, run through that flame 
awww man, running through your mind 
you took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail 
and you swirled it around your head 
and you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it 
and you knew that it would be your own 
but you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die 
because you know you would feel your own 
you would feel your own 
but you're remembered! 
you're remembered! 
you're remembered DEAD! 
you're remembered DEAD! 
you're remembered DEAD! 
we remember 
we remember 
we remember 
everything 
everything

 


MOTHER ROSE

 (Smith/Shanahan) 
 
Mother rose Every little morn' 
To tend to me There she stood 
Waiting by the door Selflessly 
 
Took my hand Took it with a smile tenderly 
Mother rose Every little morn' 
To tend to me Now's the time 
To turn the view Now that I have you 
 
And I'll rise Every little morn' 
To tend to thee When you rise 
Open up your eyes You will see 
There I'll be Waiting by the door 
Come to me Take my hand 
Look into your heart There I'll be 
 
Now's the time To turn the view 
Now that I have you 
 
Now's the time To turn the view 
Now that I have you 
 
Roses growing by my door Climbing up the vine 
All the thorns and pain obscured Roses shall divine 
Where we feel no pain And the love inside 
Where roses climb Roses shall divine 
Roses shall divine Holy mother 
Mother of gold Mother with stories 
Told and retold She felt our tears 
Heard our sighs And turned to gold 
Before our eyes She rose into the light 
She rose into the light She rose into the light

 


MY BLAKEAN YEAR

 (Smith) 
 
In my Blakean year I was so disposed 
Toward a mission yet unclear Advancing pole by pole 
 
Fortune breathed into my ear Mouthed a simple ode 
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road 
 
In my Blakean year Such a woeful schism 
The pain of our existence Was not as I envisioned 
 
Boots that trudged from track to track Worn down to the sole 
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road 
 
Boots that tramped from track to track Worn down to the sole 
One road was paved in gold One road was just a road 
 
In my Blakean year Temptation but a hiss 
Just a shallow spear Robed in cowardice 
 
Brace yourself for bitter flack For a life sublime 
A labyrinth of riches Never shall unwind 
The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack Are stitched into the Blakean back 
 
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear 
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year 
 
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear 
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year

 


MY MADRIGAL

 We waltzed beneath motionless skies 
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes 
we expressed such sweet vows 
 
oh till death do us part 
oh till death do us part 
oh oh 
 
We waltzed beneath God's point of view 
knowing no ending to our rendezvous 
we expressed such sweet vows 
 
oh till death do us part 
oh till death do us part 
oh oh 
 
oh till death do us part 
oh till death do us part 
oh oh 
 
We waltzed beneath motionless skies 
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes 
you pledged me your heart 
 
till death do us part 
you pledged me your heart 
till death do us part 
till death do us part

 


NEW PARTY

 (Smith/Shanahan) 
 
You say hey 
The state of the union 
Is fine fine fine 
I got the feeling that you're lying 
Lying lying lying 
I think we need 
Think we're gonna need 
A new party 
 
They say to me 
They say what's the word 
I say it's thunderbird 
I say it's thunderbird 
Why don't you 
Fly fly fly 
Fly away hey 
And while you're at it 
Why don't you 
Fertilize my lawn 
Why don't you 
Fertilize my lawn 
With what's running from your mouth 
Running from your mouth 
Hey listen here 
 
We got to get off 
Our ass or get burned 
The world's troubles 
Are a global concern 
Does your child have 
Fresh water to drink 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are you're invited 
To think about this 
 
When in the course 
Of human events 
It becomes necessary 
To take things into your own hands 
To take the water from the well 
And declare it tainted by greed 
We got to surely clean it up 
Clean our house 
Our inner house 
Our outer house 
Left right 
And hey by the way 
The human event 
Is the party of the century 
And you're all invited 
It's where you are 
Wherever you are 
'Cause this party 
Is for everyone 
And the price of admission 
Is love one another 
Love brother

 


NOTES TO THE FUTURE

 Listen my children and you shall hear 
The sound of your own steps 
The sound of your hereafter 
Memory awaits and turns to greet you 
Draping its banner across your wrists 
Wake up arms 
Delicate feet 
For as one to march the streets 
 
Each alone, each part of another 
Your steps shall ring 
Shall raise the cloud 
And they that will hear will hear 
Will hear voice of the one 
And the one and the one 
As it has never been uttered before 
 
For something greater yet to come 
Then the hour of the prophets 
And their great cities 
 
For the people of Ninevah 
Fell to their knees 
Heeding the cry of Jonah 
United 
Covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes 
And called to their god 
 
And all their hearts were as one heart. 
And all their voices were as one voice. 
 
God heard them and his mind was moved. 
 
Yet something greater will come to pass. 
And who will call? 
And what will they call? 
Will they call to God? 
The air? 
The fowl? 
 
It will not matter, if the call is true. 
They shall call and this is known. 
One voice and each another 
Shall enter the dead, the living flower, 
Enter forms that we know not. 
To be felt by sea, 
By air, 
By earth 
And shall be an elemental pledge. 
 
This is our birthright. 
This is our charge. 
And we have given over to others. 
And they have 
not 
done 
well 
 
And the forests mourn. 
The leaves fall. 
 
Swaddling babes watch and wonder 
As the fathers of our spirit nations 
Dance in the street in celebration 
As the mountains turn pale from 
Their nuclear hand 
And they have 
not 
done 
well 
 
Now my children 
You must overturn the tables 
Deliver the future from material rule 
For only one rule should be considered 
 
The eleventh commandment 
To love one another 
And this is our covenant across your wrist 
 
This offering is yours 
To adorn, adore 
To bury 
To burn 
Upon a mound 
 
To hail 
To set away 
 
It is merely a cloth, 
Merely our colors, 
Invested with the blood of the people 
All their hopes and dreams. 
 
Our flag 
It has its excellence 
Yet it is nothing 
It shall not be a tyranny above us 
 
Nor should god 
Nor love 
Nor nature 
 
Yet we hold as our pleasure this tender honor 
That we acknowledge the individual 
And the common ground formed 
 
And if our cloth be raised and lowered 
Half mast 
What does it tell us? 
 
That an individual has passed 
Is saluted 
And mourned by his countrymen. 
 
This ritual extends to us all. 
For we are all the individual. 
 
No unknown. 
No insignificant one 
Nor insignificant labor 
Nor insignificant act of charity 
 
Each has a story to be told and retold 
Which shall be a glowing thread 
In the fabric of Man 
 
And the children shall march 
And bring the colors forward 
Investing within them 
 
The redeeming blood 
Of their revolutionary hearts.

 


ONE VOICE

 (Smith/Daugherty) 
 
In the garden of consciousness 
In fertile mind there lies the dormant 
seed 
When blooming as charity 
Conscience breathes a sigh of relief 
The confessions of sleep 
The awakening seed 
Moved by love to serve 
We celebrate all 
Merit in life 
Ah, the confessions of sleep 
Unfolding peace 
As we extend 
According to need 
And you will hear the call 
All action great and small 
Received joyfully 
Heaven abounds 
Let love resound 
If he be mute 
Give him a bell 
If he be blind, an eye 
It he be down, a hand 
Lift up your voice 
Lift up your voice 
Lift up your voice 
Give of your mind one mind 
Give of your heart one heart 
Give of your voice 
One voice

 


PATHS THAT CROSS

 Speak to me 
Speak to me heart 
I feel a needing 
to bridge the clouds 
Softly go 
A way I wish to know 
A way I wish to know 
 
Oh you'll ride 
Surely dance 
In a ring 
Backwards and forwards 
Those who seek 
feel the glow 
A glow we will all know 
A glow we will all know 
 
On that day 
Filled with grace 
And the heart's communion 
Steps we take 
Steps we trace 
Into the light of reunion 
 
Paths that cross 
will cross again 
Paths that cross 
will cross again 
 
Speak to me 
Speak to me shadow 
I spin from the wheel 
nothing at all 
Save the need 
the need to weave 
A silk of souls 
that whisper whisper 
A silk of souls 
that whispers to me 
 
Speak to me heart 
all things renew 
hearts will mend 
round the bend 
Paths that cross 
cross again 
Paths that cross 
will cross again 
 
Rise up hold the reins 
We'll meet again I don't know when 
Hold tight bye bye 
Paths that cross 
will cross again 
Paths that cross 
Will cross again

PEACEABLE KINGDOM

 (Smith/Shanahan) 
 
Yesterday I saw you standing there With your hand against the pane 
Looking out the window At the rain 
 
And I wanted to tell you That your tears were not in vain 
But I guess we both knew We'd never be the same 
Never be the same 
 
Why must we hide all these feelings inside? 
Lions and lambs shall abide 
 
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again 
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again 
Build it back again 
 
Why must we hide all these feelings inside? Lions and lambs shall abide 
 
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again 
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again 
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again 
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again 
 
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again

 


PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER

 I was dreaming in my dreaming 
of an aspect bright and fair 
and my sleeping it was broken 
but my dream it lingered near 
in the form of shining valleys 
where the pure air recognized 
and my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 
that the people / have the power 
to redeem / the work of fools 
upon the meek / the graces shower 
it's decreed / the people rule 
 
The people have the power 
The people have the power 
The people have the power 
The people have the power 
 
Vengeful aspects became suspect 
and bending low as if to hear 
and the armies ceased advancing 
because the people had their ear 
and the shepherds and the soldiers 
lay beneath the stars 
exchanging visions 
and laying arms 
to waste / in the dust 
in the form of / shining valleys 
where the pure air / recognized 
and my senses / newly opened 
I awakened / to the cry 
 
Refrain 
 
Where there were deserts 
I saw fountains 
like cream the waters rise 
and we strolled there together 
with none to laugh or criticize 
and the leopard 
and the lamb 
lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
to recall what I had found 
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
god knows / a purer view 
as I surrender to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 
 
Refrain 
 
The power to dream / to rule 
to wrestle the world from fools 
it's decreed the people rule 
it's decreed the people rule 
LISTEN 
I believe everything we dream 
can come to pass through our union 
we can turn the world around 
we can turn the earth's revolution 
we have the power 
People have the power ...

PERSUASION

 (F. Smith/P. Smith) 
 
What is the system that gets around 
Recruits hearts with its timeless 
rhythm 
The young glow but old men know 
It's all a part of some crazy schism 
 
Coming on like the dawn unrelenting 
light 
Streets thick with its radiating 
It's all aglow but we all know 
True love is so complicated 
 
Feeling funny don't know why 
On a plane circling high 
Equation persuasion 
It's just persuasion 
 
What is the body that has nobody 
Go through life with nobody at all 
It come and go where the wind blow 
When persuasion come to call 
 
Got me reeling don't know why 
I'm on a plane circling high 
Equation persuasion 
Got the feeling I'm running in place 
Caught in the orbit of the human race 
Equation persuasion 
It's just persuasion 
It's jut persuasion 
It's just persuasion 
 
What is the body that has nobody 
What is the rise without the fall 
What is illusion without beauty 
What is the system that's no system 
at all 
 
Hey scout there's no equation 
You can't prepare for the heart's 
invasion 
You can't prepare for the heart's 
invasion 
Love is its own

 


PISS FACTORY

 Sixteen and time to pay off 
I got this job in a piss factory inspecting pipe 
Forty hours thirty six dollars a week 
But it's a paycheck, Jack. 
It's so hot in here, hot like Sahara 
You could faint in the heat 
But these bitches are just too lame to understand 
Too goddamned grateful to get this job 
To know they're getting screwed up the ass 
All these women they got no teeth or gum or cranium 
And the way they suck hot sausage 
But me well I wasn't sayin' too much neither 
I was moral school girl hard working asshole 
I figured I was speedo motorcycle 
I had to earn my dough, had to earn my dough 
 
But no you gotta, you gotta [relate, babe,] 
You gotta find the rhythm within 
Floor boss slides up to me and he says 
 Hey sister, you just movin' too fast, 
You screwin' up the quota, 
You doin' your piece work too fast, 
Now you get off your mustang sally 
You ain't goin' nowhere, you ain't goin' nowhere. 
I lay back. I get my nerve up. I take a swig of Romilar 
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook and I say 
 Hey, hey sister it don't matter whether I do labor fast or slow, 
There's always more labor after. 
She's real Catholic, see. She fingers her cross and she says 
 There's one reason. There's one reason. 
You do it my way or I push your face in. 
We knee you in the john if you don't get off your get off your mustang Sally, 
If you don't shake it up baby. Shake it up, baby. Twist & shout 
Oh that I could will a radio here. James Brown singing 
 I Lost Someone or the Jesters and the Paragons 
And Georgie Woods the guy with the goods and Guided Missiles ... 
But no, I got nothin', no diversion, no window, 
Nothing here but a porthole in the plaster, in the plaster, 
Where I look down, look at sweet Theresa's convent 
All those nurses, all those nuns scattin' 'round 
With their bloom hoods like cats in mourning. 
Oh to me they, you know, to me they look pretty damn free down there 
Down there not having crystal smooth 
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel 
Not having to worry about the [inspeed] the dogma the [inspeed] of labor 
They look pretty damn free down there, 
And the way they smell, the way they smell 
And here I gotta be up here smellin' Dot Hook's midwife sweat 
I would rather smell the way boys smell 
Oh those schoolboys the way their legs flap under the desks in study hall 
That odor rising roses and ammonia 
And way their dicks droop like lilacs 
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell 
But no I got, I got pink clammy lady in my nostril 
Her against the wheel me against the wheel 
Oh slow motion inspection is drivin' me insane 
In steel next to Dot Hook oh we may look the same 
Shoulder to shoulder sweatin' 110 degrees 
But I will never faint, I will never faint 
They laugh and they expect me to faint but I will never faint 
I refuse to lose, I refuse to fall down 
Because you see it's the monotony that's got to me 
Every afternoon like the last one 
Every afternoon like a rerun next to Dot Hook 
And yeah we look the same 
Both pumpin' steel, both sweatin' 
But you know she got nothin' to hide 
And I got something to hide here called desire 
I got something to hide here called desire 
And I will get out of here 
You know the fiery potion is just about to come 
In my nose is the taste of sugar 
And I got nothin' to hide here save desire 
And I'm gonna go, I'm gonna get out of here 
I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna get on that train, 
I'm gonna go on that train and go to New York City 
I'm gonna be somebody, I'm gonna get on that train, go to New York City, 
I'm gonna be so bad I'm gonna be a big star and I will never return, 
Never return, no, never return, to burn out in this piss factory 
And I will travel light. 
Oh, watch me now.

 


PISSING IN A RIVER

 Pissing in a river, watching it rise 
Tattoo fingers shy away from me 
Voices voices mesmerize 
Voices voices beckoning sea 
Come come come come back come back 
Come back come back come back 
 
Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon 
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free. 
When are you coming ? Hope you come soon 
Fingers, fingers encircling thee 
Come come come come come come 
Come come come come come come for me oh 
 
My bowels are empty, excreting your soul 
What more can I give you ? Baby I don't know 
What more can I give you to make this thing grow? 
Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you 
 
Should I pursue a path so twisted ? 
Should I crawl defeated and gifted ? 
Should I go the length of a river 
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river] 
Everything I've done, I've done for you 
Oh I give my life for you. 
Every move I made I move to you, 
And I came like a magnet for you now. 
 
What about it, you're gonna leave me, 
What about it, you don't need me, 
What about it, I can't live without you, 
What about it, I never doubted you 
What about it ? What about it ? 
What about it ? What about it ? 
 
Should I pursue a path so twisted ? 
Should I crawl defeated and gifted ? 
Should I go the length of a river, 
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river] 
What about it, what about it, what about it ? 
Oh, I'm pissing in a river.

POPPIES

 He's delighted to love me, but you know, 
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know. 
 
Heard it on the radio, it's no good 
Heard it on the radio, it's news to me 
When she gets something, it's understood 
Baby's got somethin' she's not used to 
 
Down, down, poppy, yeah 
Down, down, poppy, yeah 
 
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score 
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to 
Baby wants somethin', I want more 
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue 
 
Down, down, and it's really comin', really comin', 
Down, down, poppy, yeah 
 
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score 
Baby's got somethin', gonna get through, through 
When I want somethin' I want more, 
Heard it on the radio, there's nothin' I can do do 
 
I'm in the mood to And I'm a woman and an individual 
And I want rockin' real slow I wanna hear it on the radio 
I wanna hear it, I wanna score (poppies) I wanna hear 
it on the radio Baby got it but baby want more 
On the radio, heard it on the radio 
Baby got it but baby want more 
[babble] 
Heard it on the radio Won't be no need for layin' in the road 
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah Baby got it but baby want more 
She won't need it any more [babble] 
Although she was tense and lean in the sun Splintered like a country 
Gently pulled his finger 
Everything is soakin' and spread with butter 
Their flowers on an average [on the seed?] 
 
And then they laid her on the table 
She connected with the inhaler 
And the needle shiftin' like crazy, 
She was, she was completely still. 
It was like a painting of a vase, 
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast 
Through the dorsal spine and down and around 
(I want more) 
The anal cavity, her cranium 
(I wanna score) 
Just, it was really great, man, 
The gas had inflicted her entire spine 
With the elements of a voluptuous disease 
With a green vapor, made her feet light 
 
Baby want more 
 
Baby was it in the closet. 
Baby get it there, baby tag it, 
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby 
 
I don't think (after station) there's any station 
(I remember when) 
Quite as interesting to me 
(baby worship something) 
As the 12th station 
(laughin' at the flowers) 
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries 
Were calling to me 
And I spin, come down thru time 
Oh, watch them say you're too high 
 
And I swim through 
 
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio, 
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio 
[babble] 
one long ecstatic pure sensation 
restriction started excreting, started excreting, ah exhilarating 
bottomless pit 
 
Hey Sheba, hey Salome, hey Venus eclipsin' my way ah. 
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic. 
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning

 


PRIVILEGE (SET ME FREE)

 I see it all before me: 
the days of love and torment; 
the nights of rock and roll. 
I see it all before me. 
Sometimes my spirit's empty; 
don't have the will to go on. 
I wish someone would send me 
energy. 
 
Give me something. 
Give me something to give. 
Oh, God, give me something: 
a reason to live. 
My body is aching. 
Don't want sympathy. 
Come on. Come and love me. 
Come on. Set me free. 
Set me free. 
 
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. 
He leadeth me beside the still waters. 
He restoreth my soul. 
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name's sake. 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. 
 
Hey, Lord, I'm waitin' for you. 
Oh, God, I'm waitin' for you; 
waitin' to open Your ninety eight wounds 
and be Thee, be Thee. 
Lead me, oh, lead me. 
 
Leave me something. 
Leave me something to live. 
Oh, God, give me something: 
a reason to live. 
I don't want no handout; 
no, not sympathy. 
Come on. Come and love me. 
Come on. Set me free. 
Set me free. 
Come on. Set me free 
Set me free . . . 
 
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young. 
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young. 
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn. 
Set me free. 
 
In the presence of my enemies, 
Thou anointest my head with oil. 
My cup runneth over. 
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me 
all the days of my life. 
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. 
 
Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn. 
Here I am.

 


PRIVILEGE (SET ME FREE)

 I see it all before me: 
the days of love and torment; 
the nights of rock and roll. 
I see it all before me. 
Sometimes my spirit's empty; 
don't have the will to go on. 
I wish someone would send me 
energy. 
 
Give me something. 
Give me something to give. 
Oh, God, give me something: 
a reason to live. 
My body is aching. 
Don't want sympathy. 
Come on. Come and love me. 
Come on. Set me free. 
Set me free. 
 
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. 
He leadeth me beside the still waters. 
He restoreth my soul. 
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name's sake. 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

RADIO BAGHDAD

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction 
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis 
But extend your hand Extend your hand 
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace 
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy 
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought 
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems 
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates 
In the realm of peace All the world revolved 
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle 
City of Baghdad City of scholars 
Empirical humble Center of the world 
City in ashes City of Baghdad 
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof 
 
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep 
Deep in the veins of the great rivers 
That form the base Of Eden 
And the tree The tree of knowledge 
Held up its arms To the sky 
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge 
Cradling Cradling 
Civilization In the realm of peace 
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle 
Oh Baghdad Center of the world 
City of ashes With its great mosques 
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like 
a speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky 
Oh, clouds around We created the zero 
But we mean nothing to you You would believe 
That we are just some mystical tale We are just a swollen belly 
That gave birth to Sinbad, Scheherazade We gave birth 
Oh, oh, to the zero The perfect number 
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you 
Our children run through the streets 
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars 
Shock and awe Shock and awe 
Like some, some Imagined warrior production 
Twenty first century No chivalry involved 
No Bushido 
 
Oh, the code of the West Long gone 
Never been Where does it lie? 
You came, you came Through the west 
Annihilated a people And you come to us 
But we are older than you You come you wanna 
You wanna come and rob the cradle 
Of civilization And you read yet you read 
You read Genesis You read of the tree 
You read of the tree Beget by god 
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge 
Of the cradle of civilization 
 
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates 
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep 
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see 
What garden beneath her feet The one you drill 
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth 
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels 
Sapphires You make bracelets 
Round your own world We are weeping tears 
Rubies We offer them to you 
We are just Your Arabian nightmare 
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you 
Your Arabian nightmare 
 
City of stars City of scholarship 
Science City of ideas 
City of light City 
City of ashes That the great Caliph 
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle 
And they built a city A perfect city of Baghdad 
In the realm of peace And all the world revolved 
And they invented And they mean nothing to you 
Nothing to you Nothing 
 
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child 
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby 
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad 
Go to sleep Sleep my child 
Sleep Sleep... 
Run Run... 
 
You sent your lights Your bombs 
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe 
Like some crazy t.v. show 
 
They're robbing the cradle of civilization 
They're robbing the cradle of civilization 
They're robbing the cradle of civilization 
 
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor 
Suffer not But extend your hand

 


RAVENS

 Common fortune seeks us all 
and slips our binding rings 
we'll turn our heads 
and make us reel 
we'll bare our arms as wings 
 
before our feet a feather drifts 
beyond us it will fall 
cause time will bid and make us rise 
make ravens of us all 
 
My love he breathed the air of kings 
yet fell beneath his luck 
and in his heart a yearning yet 
before his time time shook 
all the gifts that God had gave 
and those by fate denied 
gone to where all treasures laid 
and where the raven flies 
 
oh there are places I agree 
where I have yet to roam 
the Egyptian field 
the arctic sea where shadows 
haunt and moan 
but none but sky 
I have to go 
should I return to thee 
gone to where the feather flies 
to all eternity 
but for a time I got more time 
till I a raven be 
 
cause time will bid and make us rise 
make ravens of us all 
and time will bid and make us fly 
make ravens of us all 
and time will bid and make us fly 
make ravens of us all

 


REDONDO BEACH

 Late afternoon, dreaming hotel 
We just had the quarrel that sent you away. 
I was looking for you, are you gone gone ? 
Called you on the phone, another dimension. 
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean. 
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone ? 
 
Down by the ocean it was so dismal, 
Women all standing with a shock on their faces. 
Sad description, oh I was looking for you. 
 
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up 
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad. 
I was looking for you, are you gone gone ? 
Pretty little girl, everyone cried. 
She was the victim of sweet suicide. 
I went looking for you, are you gone gone ? 
 
Down by the ocean it was so dismal, 
Women all standing with shock on their faces. 
Sad description, oh I was looking for you. 
 
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up, 
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now. 
I went looking for you, are you gone gone ? 
Picked up my key, didn't reply. 
Went to my room, started to cry. 
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone ? 
 
Down by the ocean it was so dismal. 
I was just standing with shock on my face. 
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you. 
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone. 
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone. 
Gone gone, gone gone, good bye.

REVENGE

 I feel upset. 
Let's do some celebrating. 
Come on honey, don't hesitate now. 
Needed you, you withdrew, I was so forsaken. 
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move. 
I believe I'll be taking my revenge. 
Sweet revenge. 
 
I thought you were some perfect read out. 
Some d digital delay had obscured 
and phased my view of the wicked hand you played. 
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out, run out, ah you better face it. 
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck 
I do know how to replace it with revenge. 
Oh, sweet revenge. 
 
I gave you a wristwatch, baby. 
You wouldn't even give me the time of day. 
You want to know what makes me tick. 
Now it's me that's got precious little to say. 
For the ghosts of our love have dried have died. 
There's no use faking it. 
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight. 
High time I was taking my revenge. 
Sweet revenge. 
Revenge. Revenge. 
 
all the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you. it's so immaterial.

you ain't gonna need no you ain't gonna need no little boat you are living on my time my dear. 
Revenge. Sweet revenge. Sweet sweet revenge. . .

 


ROCK 'N' ROLL NIGGER

 Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore. 
Baby got big and baby get bigger. 
Baby get something. Baby get more. 
Baby, baby, baby was a rock and roll nigger. 
Oh, look around you, all around you, 
riding on a copper wave. 
Do you like the world around you? 
Are you ready to behave? 
 
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me. 
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.

Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore. 
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger.

I was lost in the infinite sea. 
I was lost, and measure for measure, 
love spewed from the heart of me. 
I was lost, and the cost, 
and the cost didn't matter to me. 
I was lost, and the cost 
was to be outside society. 
 
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger. 
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too. 
Jackson Pollock was a nigger. 
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,

SEVEN WAYS OF GOING

 I've got seven ways of going, seven wheres to be, 
seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee. 
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me. 
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity. 
Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night. 
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right. 
 
Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome. 
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me, 
lo I turned my neck toward home. 
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life, 
'til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light. 
 
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true. 
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You. 
 
As I move thru seven levels 
As I move upon the slate 
As I declare to you 
The number of my moves 
As I speculate the eighth 
Seeking love without exception 
A light upon the swarm 
Seeking love without exception 
A saint in any form.

SPACE MONKEY

 Blood on the T.V., ten o'clock news. 
Souls are invaded, heart in a groove. 
Beatin' and beatin' so outta time. 
What's the mad matter with the church chimes? 
Here comes a stranger up on Ninth Avenue. 
Leanin' green tower, indiscreet view. 
Over the cloud, over the bridge, 
sensitive muscle, sensitive ridge of my 
space monkey. Sign of the time time 
Space monkey, so outta line line. 
Space monkey, sort of divine. 
And he's mine, mine, all mine. 
 
Pierre Clementi, snot full o' cocaine. 
The sexual streets, why it's all so insane. 
Humans are running, lavender room. 
Hoverin' liquid, move over moon for my 
space monkey. Sign of the time time 
Space monkey, sort of divine vine 
Space monkey, so out of line and he's mine, mine, oh he's mine 
 
(spoken) 
A stranger comes up to him; hands him an old, rusty Polaroid. 
It starts crumbling in his hands. 
He says, Oh man, I don't get the picture. This is no picture. 
This is just...this just a...this just a... 
This is my jack knife. This is my jack knife. 
This is my jack knife. This is my jack. [shriek] 
 
Rude excavation, landin' site. 
Boy hesitatin', jack knife. 
He rips his leg open, so out of time. 
Blood and light runnin'. It's all like a dream. 
Light of my life, he's dressed in flame. 
It's all so predestined. It's all such a game for my 
space monkey. Sign of the time time. 
Space monkey, sort of divine vine. 
Space monkey, so out of line and it's all just space, just space. 
 
There he is, up in a tree. 
Oh, I hear him callin' down to me. 
That banana shaped object ain't no banana. 
It's a bright, yellow U.F.O. 
And he's coming to get me. Here I go. 
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up ,up, up ... 
Oh, goodbye mama. I'll never do dishes again. 
Here I go from my body. 
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Help!

STRANGE MESSENGERS

 (Smith/Kaye) 
 
I looked upon the book of life 
Tracing the lines of face after face 
Looking down at their naked feet 
Bound in chains bound in chains 
Chains of leather chains of gold 
We knew it was wrong but we looked 
away 
And paraded them down the colonial 
streets 
And that's how they became enslaved 
 
They came across on the great ships 
Mothers separated from their babes 
Husbands stood on the auction block 
Bound in chains bound in chains 
Chains of leather chains of gold 
Men knew it was wrong but they looked 
away 
And led them to toil in fields of white 
As they turned their necks to a bitter 
landscape 
 
Oh the people I hear them calling 
Am I not a man and a brother 
Am I not a woman and a sister 
 
History sends us such strange 
messengers 
They come down through time 
To embrace to enrage 
And in their arms even stranger fruit 
And they swing from the trees 
With their vision in flames 
Ropes of leather ropes of gold 
Men knew it was wrong but they looked 
away 
Messengers swinging from twisted rope 
As they turned their necks to a bitter 
landscape 
 
Oh the people I hear them calling 
Am I not a man and a brother 
Am I not a woman and a siste 
r We will be heard we will be heard

 


STRIDE OF THE MIND

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
I took a walk out to the sun But I just, just couldn't take it 
I followed a dream It was circular 
But I just, just could not fake it 
 
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right 
Pick up the sign the sign the sign For a stride of the mind the mind 
 
Simon of the desert blew into town On the scalding tail of a bright cold wind 
Slipped through the sand Footprints emerged 
Where no one was walking Simon had been 
 
Dropped from heaven To a ready made world 
Said I'm no Sufi But I'll give it a whirl 
We booked passage on the Book of the Dead 
Time to travel Simon said 
 
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right 
Pick up the sign the sign the sign On the stride of the mind the mind the mind 
 
Come on move where dreams increase Where every man is a masterpiece 
If you want to be counted As another kind 
And you're true, pursue Stride of the mind the mind the mind... 
 
He bowed three times Removed his fez 
Pointed to heaven And Simon says 
The mind the mind the mind Pick up the sign the mind the mind 
It's a vertical climb the climb the climb Stride of the mind the mind the mind 
Pick up the sign the sign the sign It's a vertical climb the climb 
Take it in stride

 


SUMMER CANNIBALS

 I was down in Georgia 
nothing was as real 
as the street beneath my feet 
descending into air 
 
The cauldron was a bubbling 
the flesh was lean 
and the women moved forward 
like piranhas in a stream 
they spread themselves before me 
an offering so sweet 
and they beckoned and they beckoned 
come on darling eat 
 
Eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
 
They circled around me 
natives in a ring 
and I saw their souls a withering 
like snakes in chains 
and they wrapped themselves around me 
ummm what a treat 
and they rattled their tales hissin' 
come on let's eat 
 
Eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
 
I felt a rising in my throat 
the girls a saying grace 
and the air the viscous air 
pressed against my face 
and it all got too damn much for me 
just got too damn rough 
and I pushed away my plate 
and said boys I've had enough 
and I laid upon the table 
another piece of meat 
and I opened up my veins to them 
and said come on eat 
 
Eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals

Cause I was down in Georgia 
nothing was as real 
as the street beneath my feet 
descending into hell 
 
So eat eat eat 
you eat eat eat 
you eat eat eat

SUMMER CANNIBALS

 I was down in Georgia 
nothing was as real 
as the street beneath my feet 
descending into air 
 
The cauldron was a bubbling 
the flesh was lean 
and the women moved forward 
like piranhas in a stream 
they spread themselves before me 
an offering so sweet 
and they beckoned and they beckoned 
come on darling eat 
 
Eat the summer cannibals 
eat eat eat 
you eat the summer cannibals

THE JACKSON SONG

 Little blue dreamer go to sleep 
Let's close our eyes and call the deep 
slumbering land that just begins 
When day is done and little dreamers spin 
 
First take my hand now let it go 
Little blue boy you're on your own 
Little blue wings as those feet fly 
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky 
 
May your path be your own 
But I'm with you 
And each day you'll grow 
He'll be there too 
And someday when you go 
We'll follow you 
As you go, as you go 
 
Little blue star that offers light 
Little blue bird that offers flight 
Little blue path where those feet fall 
Little blue dreamer won't you dream it all 
 
Refrain 
 
And in your travels you will see 
Warrior wings remember Daddy 
And if a mama bird you see 
Folding her wings will you remember me 
As you go, as you go 
As you go, as you go

 


THE WICKED MESSENGER

 (Bob Dylan) 
 
There was a wicked messenger 
From Eli he did come, 
With a mind that multiplied 
The smallest matter. 
When questioned who had sent for him, 
He answered with his thumb, 
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter. 
 
He stayed behind the assembly hall, 
It was there he made his bed, 
Oftentimes he could be seen returning. 
Until one day he just appeared 
With a note in his hand which read, 
 The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning. 
 
Oh, the leaves began to fallin' 
And the seas began to part, 
And the people that confronted him were many. 
And he was told but these few words, 
Which opened up his heart, 
 If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any. 

 


TILL VICTORY

 Raise the sky. 
We got to fly over the land, over the sea. 
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise. 
God, do not seize me please, till victory. 
 
Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame 
No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame. 
Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite. 
 
And you will see us coming, V formation, through the sky. 
Film survives. Eyes cry. 
On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound. 
Oh, oh oh. Down and down. 
Down and round, oh, down and round. 
Round and round, oh, round and round. 
 
Rend the veil and we shall sail. 
The nail, the grail: That's all behind thee. 
In deed, in creed, the curve of our speed. 
And we believe that we will raise the sky. 
We got to fly over the land, over the sea. 
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise. 
God, do not seize me please, till victory. 
 
Victory. Till victory. [repeat]

TRAMPIN'

 I'm trampin', trampin' Try'n a make heaven my home 
I'm trampin trampin Try'n a make heaven my home... 
 
I've never been to heaven But I've been told 
Try'n a make heaven my home That the streets up there 
Are paved with gold Try'n a make heaven my home 
 
I'm trampin trampin Try'n a make heaven my home 
I'm trampin trampin Try'n a make heaven my home...

 


TRESPASSES

 (Smith/Daugherty) 
 
Life is designed With unfinished lines 
That another sings Each story unfolds 
Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing 
 
The bold and the fair Suffer their share 
He whispered to his kin All of my debts 
Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything 
 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
 
And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care 
The burdens that were his Mending the coat 
That hung on the post In heart remembering 
 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
 
And her time was to come Called to her son 
This your song to sing All of our debts 
Wove with regrets Upon a golden string 
And he found the old coat Hung on a post 
Like a ragged wing And took as his own 
The sewn and unsown Joyfully whistling

 


UP THERE DOWN THERE

 Up there 
There's a ball of fire 
Some call it the spirit 
Some call it the sun 
Its energies are not for hire 
It serves man / It serves everyone 
Down there where Jonah wails 
in the healing water 
in the ready depths 
Twisting like silver swans 
No line of death no boundaries 
 
Up there 
The eye is hollow / The eye is winking 
The winds ablaze / Angels howling 
The sphinx awakens / But what can she say 
You'd be amazed 
 
Down there 
Your days are numbers 
Nothing to fear 
There will be trumpets 
There will be silence 
In the end the end 
Will be here just here 
 
Ahh the borders of heaven 
Are zipped up tight tonight 
The abstract streets 
The lights like some switched on Mondrian 
Cats like us are obsolete 
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet 
Thieves, poets we're inside out 
And everybody's a soldier 
Angels howl at those abstract lights 
And the borders of heaven 
Are zipped up tight tonight 
 
Up there 
There's a ball of fire 
Some call it the spirit 
Some call it the sun 
Its energies are not for hire 
It serves man / It serves everyone 
The air we breathe 
The flame of wisdom 
The earth we grind 
The beckoning sea 
It's no mystery / Not sentimental 
Ahh the equation / It's all elemental 
 
The world is restless 
Heaven in flux / Angels appear 
From the bright storm 
Out of the shadows 
Up there, down there 
But what can we say 
Man's been forewarned 
 
All communion is not holy 
Even those that fall 
They can prophet understanding 
It's all for man / It's for everyone 
It's up there, down there 
Everywhere / Everywhere 
Time for communion / Time for communion 
Talking communion ...

 


UPRIGHT COME

 (Smith/Ray) 
 
Hail brother 
The distant thunder 
Is nothing but hearts 
Beating as one 
Dance of a million 
On God's pavilion 
Come come 
Beat on your drum 
 
Awake people arise 
Awake upright come 
Fortune is falling like 
Tears from the skies 
Open your eyes 
 
Hail sister 
Come on over 
To shape reshape 
Things to come 
Bow your head 
Raise your lantern 
Come come 
Beat on your drum 
 
Awake people arise 
Awake upright come 
Fortune is falling like 
Tears from the skies 
Open your eyes 
 
United action is what we need 
Time to say that everything is going to 
be 
Wasted icons wasted lives 
Like war obsolete 
 
Awake people arise 
Awake upright come 
Fortune is falling like 
Tears from the skies 
Open your eyes 
 
These are the times 
The times of our own 
These are the shapes 
The world we formed 
Swift is the arrow 
Dark is the thorn 
The slate is clean 
The future awaits 
Awake

 


WAITING UNDERGROUND

 If you believe all your hope is gone 
down the drain of your humankind 
the time has arrived 
you'll be waiting here as I was 
in a snow white shroud 
waiting underground 
 
there by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon 
where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth 
where the great ones tremble 
in their snow white shrouds 
waiting underground 
 
if you seek the kingdom come, come along 
waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering 
beneath the pilgrim moon 
where the [railroad] thunders 
 
oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth 
and as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble 
and your humankind becomes as one 
and then we will arise 
in our snow white shrouds 
when we'll be as one 
but until that day we will just await 
in our snow white shrouds 
waiting underground 
in our snow white shrouds 
waiting underground 
 
Waiting underground X6

WE THREE

 (Every Sunday I will go down to the bar 
and leave him the guitar.) 
 
You say you want me. 
I want another. 
Say you dream of me. 
Dream of your brother. 
Oh, the stars shine so suspiciously 
for we three. 
 
You said when you were with me that nothing made you high. 
We drank all night together and you began to cry so recklessly. 
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me. 
 
You say you want me. 
I want another, baby. 
You say you wish for me. 
Wish for your brother. 
Oh, the dice roll so deceptively 
for we three. 
 
It was just another Saturday 
and ev'rything was in the key of A. 
And I lit a cigarette for your brother. 
And he turned and heard me say so desp'rately, 
 Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me. 
 
You say you want me. 
I want another. 
You say you pray for me. 
Pray for your brother. 
Oh, the way that I see him is the way I see myself. 
So please stand back now and let time tell you. 
Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny 
of we three? 
 
Every night on sep'rate stars, before we go to sleep, we pray so breathlessly. 
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.

 


WHEN DOVES CRY

 

 


WHERE DUTY CALLS

 In a room in Lebanon 
they silently slept 
They were dreaming crazy dreams 
in foreign alphabet 
Lucky young boys 
cross on the main 
The driver was approaching 
the American zone 
The waving of hands 
The tiniest train 
They never dreamed 
they'd never wake again 
 
Voice of the Swarm 
We follow we fall 
Some kneel for priests 
Some wail at walls 
Flag on a match head 
God or the law 
And they'll all go together 
Where duty calls 
 
United children 
Child of Iran 
Parallel prayers 
Baseball Koran 
I'll protect Mama 
I'll lie awake 
I'll die for Allah 
In a holy war 
I'll be a ranger 
I'll guard the streams 
I'll be a soldier 
A sleeping Marine 
 
Refrain 
 
In the heart of the ancient 
Ali smiles 
In the soul of the desert 
the sun blooms 
Awake 
into the glare of all out little wars 
Who pray to return to salute 
the coming and dying of the moon 
Oh sleeping sun 
 
Assassin in prayer 
laid a compass deep 
Exploding dawn 
and himself as well 
Their eyes for his eyes 
Their breath for his breath 
All to his end 
 
And a room in Lebanon 
Dust of scenes 
Erase and blend 
May the blanket of Kings 
Cover them and him 
 
Forgive them Father 
They know not what they do 
From the vast portals 
of their consciousness 
they're calling to you

 


WHIRL AWAY

 Hello friend I've come a calling 
passively stationed 
active patrol 
sliding in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff 
not want to get involved in it all 
 
who stands guard for each other 
why must we guard anything at all 
anything at all 
 
from the earth's four corners the people are calling 
forming equations but the questions are hard 
all men are brothers killing each other 
and mother earth is wringing in wonder 
 
who stands guard for each other 
why must we guard anything at all 
anything at all 
whirl away now X3 
whirl away 
 
there's a cross on the road 
there's a great mill turning 
some seeking answers 
some born to dancers 
you can hold on the blade and turn around forever 
be flung into space into another kind of grace 
 
who stands guard for each other 
why must we guard anything at all 
anything at all 
whirl away now X3 
whirl away 
whirl away now X3 
whirl away 
 
[?] 
some giveth their hand 
some giveth their land 
some giveth their life 
you lay in the fields of grain 
the staff of life all around you 
but yet you, you will cut someone down for their possessions 
some material thing 
and our children are being blown away like wishes in the wind 
for the sake of their coat 
or the colors of their coat 
or the color of their skin 
or the name on their shoes 
and the mother cries Why they taken my son? 
and the father wonders Are they taking my boy? 
he extended his hand 
he gave them his land 
he gave them his bread 
he gave them his heart 
said hello friend 
hello friend X4

 


WING

 I was a wing in heaven blue 
soared over the ocean 
soared over Spain 
and I was free 
needed nobody 
it was beautiful 
it was beautiful 
 
I was a pawn 
didn't have a move 
didn't have nowhere 
that I could go 
but I was free 
I needed nobody 
it was beautiful 
it was beautiful 
 
and if there's one thing 
could do for you 
you'd be a wing 
in heaven blue 
 
I was a vision 
in another eye 
and they saw nothing 
no future at all 
yet I was free 
I needed nobody 
it was beautiful 
it was beautiful 
 
and if there's one thing 
could do for you 
you'd be a wing 
in heaven blue 
 
and if there's one thing 
could do for you 
you'd be a wing 
in heaven blue 
 
and if there's one thing 
could do for you 
you'd be a wing 
in heaven blue
