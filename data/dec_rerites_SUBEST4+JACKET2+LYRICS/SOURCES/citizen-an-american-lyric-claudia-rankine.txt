When you are alone and too
tired even to turn on any of
your	devices,	you	let	yourself
linger in a past stacked
among your pillows. Usually
you are nestled under
blankets and the house is
empty. Sometimes the moon
is missing and beyond the
windows	the	low,	gray	ceiling
seems approachable. Its dark
light dims in degrees
depending on the density of
clouds	and	you	fall	back	into
that which gets reconstructed
as	metaphor.

The	route	is	often	associative.
You smell good. You are
twelve attending Sts. Philip
and James School on White
Plains Road and the girl
sitting	in	the	seat	behind	asks
you	to	lean	to	the	right	during
exams so she can copy what
you have written. Sister
Evelyn is in the habit of
taping the 100s and the
failing grades to the coat
closet doors. The girl is
Catholic with waist-length
brown hair. You can’t
remember her name: Mary?
Catherine?
You never really speak
except	for	the	time	she	makes
her request and later when
she tells you you smell good
and	have	features	more	like	a
white person. You assume
she	thinks	she	is	thanking	you
for	letting	her	cheat	and	feels
better cheating from an
almost	white	person.Sister Evelyn never figures
out	your	arrangement	perhaps
because you never turn
around to copy Mary
Catherine’s answers. Sister
Evelyn must think these two
girls think a lot alike or she
cares less about cheating and
more	about	humiliation	or	she
never	actually	saw	you	sitting
there.

Certain	
moments	
send
adrenaline to the heart, dry
out the tongue, and clog the
lungs. Like thunder they
drown you in sound, no, like
lightning they strike you
across the larynx. Cough.
After it happened I was at a
loss for words. Haven’t you
said this yourself? Haven’t
you	said	this	to	a	close	friend
who early in your friendship,
when distracted, would call
you	by	the	name	of	her	black
housekeeper? You assumed
you two were the only black
people in her life. Eventually
she stopped doing this,
though	
she	
never
acknowledged her slippage.

And you never called her on
it (why not?) and yet, you
don’t forget. If this were a
domestic tragedy, and it
might well be, this would be
your	
fatal	
flaw—yourmemory, vessel of your
feelings. Do you feel hurt
because it’s the “all black
people look the same”
moment, or because you are
being confused with another
after being so close to this
other?An unsettled feeling keeps
the body front and center.

The wrong words enter your
day like a bad egg in your
mouth and puke runs down
your blouse, a dampness
drawing your stomach in
toward your rib cage. When
you look around only you
remain. Your own disgust at
what you smell, what you
feel, doesn’t bring you to
your feet, not right away,
because gathering energy has
become	its	own	task,	needing
its own argument. You are
reminded of a conversation
you had recently, comparing
the merits of sentences
constructed implicitly with
“yes, and” rather than “yes,
but.” You and your friend
decided that “yes, and”
attested	to	a	life	with	no	turn-
off,	no	alternative	routes:	you
pull yourself to standing,
soon enough the blouse is
rinsed, it’s another week, the
blouse is beneath your
sweater, against your skin,
and	you	smell	good.

The rain this morning pours
from the gutters and
everywhere else it is lost in
the trees. You need your
glasses	to	single	out	what	you
know is there because doubt
is	inexorable;	you	put	on	your
glasses. The trees, their bark,
their leaves, even the dead
ones, are more vibrant wet.
Yes, and it’s raining. Each
moment	is	like	this—before	it
can	be	known,	categorized	as
similar to another thing and
dismissed, it has to be
experienced,	it	has	to	be	seen.

What	did	he	just	say?	Did	she
really	just	say	that?	Did	I	hear
what	I	think	I	heard?	Did	that
just come out of my mouth,
his mouth, your mouth? The
moment	stinks.	Still	you	want
to stop looking at the trees.
You want to walk out and
stand among them. And as
light	as	the	rain	seems,	it	still
rains	down	on	you.

You are in the dark, in the
car,	watching	the	black-tarred
street being swallowed by
speed;	he	tells	you	his	dean	is
making him hire a person of
color	when	there	are	so	many
great	writers	out	there.
You think maybe this is an
experiment	and	you	are	being
tested	
or	
retroactivelyinsulted or you have done
something	that	communicates
this is an okay conversation
to	be	having.
Why	do	you	feel	comfortable
saying this to me? You wish
the light would turn red or a
police siren would go off so
you	could	slam	on	the	brakes,
slam into the car ahead of
you, fly forward so quickly
both your faces would
suddenly be exposed to the
wind.

As usual you drive straight
through the moment with the
expected	backing	off	of	what
was previously said. It is not
only that confrontation is
headache-producing;	it	is	also
that you have a destination
that doesn’t include acting
like this moment isn’t
inhabitable, hasn’t happened
before, and the before isn’t
part of the now as the night
darkens	and	the	time	shortens
between where we are and
where	we	are	going.

When you arrive in your
driveway	and	turn	off	the	car,
you remain behind the wheel
another	ten	minutes.	You	fear
the night is being locked in
and coded on a cellular level
and	want	time	to	function	as	a
power wash. Sitting there
staring at the closed garage
door you are reminded that a
friend once told you there
exists the medical term
for people
exposed	to	stresses	stemming
from racism. They achieve
themselves to death trying to
dodge	the	buildup	of	erasure.
Sherman	
James,	
the
researcher	who	came	up	with
the term, claimed the
physiological costs were
high. You hope by sitting in
silence you are bucking the
trend.Because of your elite status
from	a	year’s	worth	of	travel,
you have already settled into
your window seat on United
Airlines, when the girl and
her	mother	arrive	at	your	row.
The	girl,	looking	over	at	you,
tells	her	mother,	these	are	our
seats, but this is not what I
expected. The mother’s
response is barely audible—I
see, she says. I’ll sit in the
middle.


A woman you do not know
wants to join you for lunch.
You are visiting her campus.
In	the	café	you	both	order	the
Caesar salad. This overlap is
not	the	beginning	of	anything
because she immediately
points	out	that	she,	her	father,
her grandfather, and you, all
attended the same college.
She wanted her son to go
there as well, but because of
affirmative	action	or	minority
something—she is not sure
what they are calling it these
days and weren’t they
supposed to get rid of it?—
her	son	wasn’t	accepted.	You
are not sure if you are meant
to	apologize	for	this	failure	of
your alma mater’s legacy
program; instead you ask
where he ended up. The
prestigious	
school	
she
mentions doesn’t seem to
assuage her irritation. This
exchange,	in	effect,	ends	your
lunch.	The	salads	arrive.

A friend argues that
Americans	battle	between	the
“historical self” and the “self
self.” By this she means you
mostly interact as friends
with mutual interest and, for
the most part, compatible
personalities;	
however,
sometimes your historical
selves, her white self and
your	black	self,	or	your	white
self	and	her	black	self,	arrive
with the full force of your
American positioning. Then
you are standing face-to-face
in seconds that wipe the
affable	smiles	right	from	your
mouths. What did you say?
Instantaneously	
your
attachment seems fragile,
tenuous, subject to any
transgression	
of	
your
historical self. And though
your	joined	personal	histories
are supposed to save you
from	misunderstandings,	they
usually cause you to
understand all too well what
is	meant.You and your partner go to
see the film The House We
Live In. You ask a friend to
pick up your child from
school. On your way home
your phone rings. Your
neighbor tells you he is
standing at his window
watching a menacing black
guy casing both your homes.
The guy is walking back and
forth talking to himself and
seems	disturbed.
You tell your neighbor that
your friend, whom he has
met, is babysitting. He says,
no, it’s not him. He’s met
your	friend	and	this	isn’t	that
nice	young	man.	Anyway,	he
wants you to know, he’s
called	the	police.
Your	partner	calls	your	friend
and	asks	him	if	there’s	a	guy
walking back and forth in
front of your home. Your
friend says that if anyone
were outside he would see
him because he is standing
outside. You hear the sirens
through	the	speakerphone.
Your friend is speaking to
your neighbor when you
arrive home. The four police
cars are gone. Your neighbor
has	apologized	to	your	friend
and is now apologizing to
you. Feeling somewhat
responsible for the actions of
your neighbor, you clumsily
tell your friend that the next
time he wants to talk on the
phone	he	should	just	go	in	the
backyard. He looks at you a
long	minute	before	saying	he
can speak on the phone
wherever he wants. Yes, of
course, you say. Yes, of
course.When	the	stranger	asks,	Why
do you care? you just stand
there staring at him. He has
just	referred	to	the	boisterous
teenagers in Starbucks as
niggers. Hey, I am standing
right	here,	you	responded,	not
necessarily expecting him to
turn	to	you.
He	is	holding	the	lidded	paper
cup in one hand and a small
paper bag in the other. They
are	just	being	kids.	Come	on,
no need to get all KKK on
them,	you	say.
Now there you go, he
responds.
The people around you have
turned away from their
screens.	The	teenagers	are	on
pause.	
 There I go? you ask,
feeling	irritation	begin	to	rain
down. Yes, and something
about	
hearing	
yourself
repeating this stranger’s
accusation in a voice usually
reserved for your partner
makes	you	smile.A man knocked	
 over her son
in	the	subway.	You	feel	your
own body wince. He’s okay,
but the son of a bitch kept
walking. She says she
grabbed the stranger’s arm
and told him to apologize: I
told him to look at the boy
and apologize. Yes, and you
want it to stop, you want the
child	pushed	to	the	ground	to
be seen, to be helped to hisfeet,	
to	be	brushed	off	by	the
person that did not see him,
has never seen him, has
perhaps never seen anyone
who is not a reflection of
himself.
The beautiful thing is that a
group of men began to stand
behind me like a fleet of
bodyguards, she says, like

the power of speech. And

she spits back. Then she

Oh,	she	says,	followed	by,	oh,

Hennessy Youngman aka
Jayson Musson, whose Art
Thoughtz take the form of
tutorials	
on	
YouTube,
educates	
viewers	
on
contemporary art issues. In
one of his many videos, he
addresses how to become a
successful black artist, wryly
suggesting black people’s
anger is marketable. He
advises black artists to
cultivate “an angry nigger
exterior”	by	watching,	among
other	things,	the	Rodney	King
video	while	working.

Youngman’s suggestions are
meant to expose expectations
for blackness as well as to
underscore the difficulty
inherent in any attempt by
black artists to metabolize
real rage. The commodified
anger his video advocates
rests	lightly	on	the	surface	for
spectacle’s sake. It can be
engaged or played like the
race	card	and	is	tied	solely	to
the performance of blackness
and	not	to	the	emotional	state
of particular individuals in
particular	situations.

On the bridge between this
sellable	anger	and	“the	artist”
resides, at times, an actual
anger.	Youngman	in	his	video
doesn’t address this type of
anger: the anger built up
through experience and the
quotidian struggles against
dehumanization every brown
or black person lives simply
because of skin color. This
other kind of anger in time
can prevent, rather than
sponsor, the production of
anything	except	loneliness.
You begin to think, maybe
erroneously, that this other
kind of anger is really a type
of knowledge: the type that
both	clarifies	and	disappoints.
It responds to insult and
attempted erasure simply by
asserting presence, and the
energy	required	to	present,	to
react,	
to	
assert	
is
accompanied by visceral
disappointment:	
a
disappointment in the sense
that no amount of visibility
will alter the ways in which
one	is	perceived.
Recognition of this lack
might break you apart. Or
recognition might illuminate
the erasure the attempted
erasure triggers. Whether
such discerning creates a
healthier, if more isolated,
self, you can’t know. In any
case, Youngman doesn’t
speak to this kind of anger.
He doesn’t say that
witnessing the expression of
this more ordinary and daily
anger	might	make	the	witness
believe that a person is
“insane.”And	insane	is	what	you	think,
one	
Sunday	
afternoon,
drinking an Arnold Palmer,
watching the 2009 Women’s
US	Open	final,	when	brought
to full attention by the
suddenly explosive behavior
of	Serena	Williams.	Serena	in
HD before your eyes
becomes overcome by a rage
you recognize and have been
taught to hold at a distance
for your own good. Serena’s
behavior, on this particular
Sunday afternoon, suggests
that all the injustice she has
played through all the years
of her illustrious career
flashes before her and she
decides finally to respond to
all of it with a string of
invectives. Nothing, not even
the repetition of negations
(“no, no, no”) she employed
in a similar situation years
before	as	a	younger	player	at
the 2004 US Open, prepares
you for this. Oh my God,
she’s gone crazy, you say to
no	one.
What does a victorious or
defeated	black	woman’s	body
in a historically white space
look	like?	Serena	and	her	big
sister	
Venus	
Williams
brought to mind Zora Neale
Hurston’s “I feel most
colored when I am thrown
against a sharp white
background.”	
Thisappropriated line, stenciled
on canvas by Glenn Ligon,
who used plastic letter
stencils, smudging oil sticks,
and graphite to transform the
words into abstractions,
seemed to be ad copy for
some aspect of life for all
black	bodies.
Hurston’s statement has been
played out on the big screen
by Serena and Venus: they
win sometimes, they lose
sometimes, they’ve been
injured, they’ve been happy,
they’ve been sad, ignored,
booed mightily (see Indian
Wells, which both sisters
have boycotted since 2001),
they’ve been cheered, and
through it all and evident to
all	were	those	people	who	are
enraged	they	are	there	at	all—
graphite	against	a	sharp	white
background.For years you attribute to
Serena Williams a kind of
resilience	appropriate	only	for
those who exist in celluloid.
Neither her father nor her
mother nor her sister nor
Jehovah her God nor NIKE
camp could shield her
ultimately from people who
felt her black body didn’t
belong	on	their	court,	in	their
world. From the start many
made it clear Serena would
have	done	better	struggling	tosurvive	
in	
the	
two-
dimensionality of a Millet
painting, rather than on their
tennis	court—better	to	put	all
that strength to work in their
fantasy of her working the
land,	rather	than	be	caught	up
in the turbulence of our
ancient dramas, like a ship
fighting a storm in a Turner
seascape.
The	
most	
notorious	
ofSerena’s detractors takes the
form of Mariana Alves, the
distinguished tennis chair
umpire. In 2004 Alves was
excused from officiating any
more	matches	on	the	final	day
of the US Open after she
made five bad calls against
Serena in her semifinal
matchup against fellow
American Jennifer Capriati.
The serves and returns Alves
called out were landing,
stunningly un returned by
Capriati, inside the lines, no
discerning eyesight needed.
Commentators, spectators,
television viewers, line
judges, everyone could see
the balls were good,
everyone, apparently, except
Alves. No one could
understand	
what	
was
happening. Serena, in her
denim skirt, black sneaker
boots, and dark mascara,
began	wagging	her	finger	and
saying “no, no, no,” as if by
negating the moment she
could propel us back into a
legible	
world.	
Tennis
superstar John McEnroe,
given his own keen eye for
injustice	
during	
his
professional career, was
shocked	that	Serena	was	able
to	hold	it	together	after	losing
the	match.
Though no one was saying
anything explicitly about
Serena’s black body, you are
not the only viewer who
thought it was getting in the
way of Alves’s sight line.
One commentator said he
hoped	he	wasn’t	being	unkind
when he stated, “Capriati
wins it with the help of the
umpires	and	the	lines	judges.”
A	year	later	that	match	would
be	credited	for	demonstrating
the need for the speedy
installation	of	Hawk-Eye,	the
line-calling technology that
took	the	seeing	away	from	the
beholder. Now the umpire’s
call can be challenged by a
replay; however, back then
after the match Serena said,
“I’m very angry and bitter
right now. I felt cheated.
Shall I go on? I just feel
robbed.”
And though you felt outrage
for	Serena	after	that	2004	US
Open,	as	the	years	go	by,	she
seems to put Alves, and a
lengthening list of other
curious calls and oversights,
against both her and her
sister, behind her as they
happen.
Yes, and the body has
memory.	
The	
physical
carriage hauls more than its
weight. The body is the
threshold across which each
objectionable call passes into
consciousness—all	
the
unintimidated, unblinking,
and unflappable resilience
does not erase the moments
lived	through,	even	as	we	are
eternally	
stupid	
or
everlastingly optimistic, so
ready to be inside, among, a
part	of	the	games.
And	here	Serena	is,	five	years
after Alves, back at the US
Open, again in a semifinal
match, this time against
Belgium’s Kim Clijsters.
Serena	is	not	playing	well	and
loses	the	first	set.	In	response
she	smashes	her	racket	on	the
court. Now McEnroe isn’t
stunned	by	her	ability	to	hold
herself	together	and	is	moved
to say, “That’s as angry as
I’ve ever seen her.” The
umpire gives her a warning;
another	violation	will	mean	a
point	penalty.She	is	in	the	second	set	at	the
critical moment of 5–6 in
Clijsters’s favor, serving to
stay in the match, at match
point. The line judge
employed	by	the	US	Open	to
watch Serena’s body, its
every move, says Serena
stepped on the line while
serving. What? (The Hawk-
Eye cameras don’t cover the
feet,	
only	
the	
ball,
apparently.) What! Are you
serious? She is serious; she
has seen a foot fault, one no
one else is able to locate
despite	the	numerous	replays.
“No	foot	fault,	you	definitely
do	not	see	a	foot	fault	there,”
says McEnroe. “That’s
overofficiating for certain,”
says another commentator.
Even the ESPN tennis
commentator, who seems
predictable	in	her	readiness	to
find fault with the Williams
sisters, says, “Her foot fault
call was way off.” Yes, and
even if there had been a foot
fault, despite the rule, they
are rarely ever called at
critical moments in a Grand
Slam match because “You
don’t make a call,” tennis
official	Carol	Cox	says,	“that
can	decide	a	match	unless	it’s
flagrant.”
As you look at the affable
Kim Clijsters, you try to
entertain	the	thought	that	this
scenario could have played
itself out the other way. And
as Serena turns to the
lineswoman and says, “I
swear to God I’m fucking
going	to	take	this	fucking	ball
and shove it down your
fucking	throat,	you	hear	that?
I	swear	to	God!”	As	offensive
as her outburst is, it is
difficult not to applaud her
for reacting immediately to
being thrown against a sharp
white background. It is
difficult not to applaud her
for existing in the moment,
for fighting crazily against
the so-called wrongness of
her body’s positioning at the
service	line.
She says in 2009, belatedly,
the words that should have
been said to the umpire in
2004, the words that might
have	snapped	Alves	back	into
focus, a focus that would
have acknowledged what
actually was happening on
the court. Now Serena’s
reaction is read as insane.
And her punishment for this
moment of manumission is
the threatened point penalty
resulting in the loss of the
match,	an	$82,500	fine,	plus	a
two-year probationary period
by	
the	
Grand	
Slam
Committee.Perhaps the committee’s
decision is only about
context,	though	context	is	not
meaning. It is a public event
being watched in homes
across	the	world.	In	any	case,
it	is	difficult	not	to	think	that
if Serena lost context by
abandoning all rules of
civility, it could be because
her body, trapped in a racial
imaginary,	
trapped	
in
disbelief—code for being
black in America—is being
governed not by the tennis
match she is participating in
but	
by	
a	
collapsed
relationship	
that	
had
promised	to	play	by	the	rules.
Perhaps this is how racism
feels no matter the context—
randomly the rules everyone
else	gets	to	play	by	no	longer
apply to you, and to call this
out	by	calling	out	“

I	swear	to
God!” is to be called insane,
crass,	
crazy.	
Bad
sportsmanship.

Two years later, September
11, 2011, Serena is playing
the Australian Sam Stosur in
the US Open final. She is
expected to win, having just
beaten the number-one
player, the Dane Caroline
Wozniacki, in the semifinal
the night before. Some
speculate Serena especially
wants	to	win	this	Grand	Slam
because it is the tenth
anniversary of the attack on
the Twin Towers. It’s
believed that by winning she
will prove her red-blooded
American patriotism and will
once and for all become
beloved by the tennis world
(think Arthur Ashe after his
death). All the bad calls, the
boos, the criticisms that she
has made ugly the game of
tennis—through her looks as
well as her behavior—that
entire	cluster	of	betrayals	will
be	wiped	clean	with	this	win.

One imagines her wanting to
say	what	her	sister	would	say
a year later after being
diagnosed with Sjögren’s
syndrome and losing her
match	to	shouts	of	“Let’s	go,
Venus!” in Arthur Ashe
Stadium: “I know this is not
proper tennis etiquette, but
this	is	the	first	time	I’ve	ever
played here that the crowd
has	been	behind	me	like	that.
Today I felt American, you
know,	for	the	first	time	at	the
US Open. So I’ve waited my
whole career to have this
moment	and	here	it	is.”
It is all too exhausting and
Serena’s	exhaustion	shows	in
her playing; she is losing, a
set and a game down. Yes,
and finally she hits a great
shot, a big forehand, and
before the ball is safely past
Sam Stosur’s hitting zone,
Serena yells, “Come on!”
thinking she has hit an
irretrievable winner. The
umpire, Eva Asderaki, rules
correctly that Serena, by
shouting, interfered with
Stosur’s	
concentration.

Subsequently, a ball that
Stosur seemingly would not
have been able to return
becomes Stosur’s point.
Serena’s reply is to ask the
umpire if she is trying to
screw her again. She
remembers the umpire doing
this to her before. As a
viewer, you too, along with
John McEnroe, begin to
wonder if this is the same
umpire	from	2004	or	2009.	It
isn’t—in	2004	it	was	Mariana
Alves and in 2009 it was
Sharon Wright; however, the
use of the word “again” by
Serena	returns	her	viewers	to
other times calling her body
out.Again Serena’s frustrations,
her disappointments, exist
within a system you
understand not to try to
understand	in	any	fair-minded
way because to do so is to
understand the erasure of the
self as systemic, as ordinary.
For Serena, the daily
diminishment is a low flame,
a constant drip. Every look,
every comment, every bad
call blossoms out of history,
through her, onto you. To

understand	is	to	see	Serena	as
hemmed	in	as	any	other	black
body thrown against our
American	
background.
“Aren’t you the one that
screwed me over last time
here?” she asks umpire
Asderaki. “Yeah, you are.
Don’t look at me. Really,
don’t even look at me. Don’t
look	my	way.	Don’t	look	my
way,” she repeats, because it
is	that	simple.

Yes,	and	who	can	turn	away?
Serena is not running out of
breath. Despite all her
understanding, she continues
to serve up aces while
smashing rackets and fraying
hems. In the 2012 Olympics
she brought home the only
two gold medals the
Americans would win in
tennis.	After	her	three-second
celebratory dance on center
court	at	the	All	England	Club,
the	American	media	reported,“


And there was Serena ...
Crip-Walking all over the
most lily-white place in the
world.... You couldn’t help
but	shake	your	head....	What
Serena did was akin to
cracking a tasteless, X-rated
joke	inside	a	church....	What
she did was immature and
classless.”

Before	making	the	video	How
to Be a Successful Black
Artist, Hennessy Youngman
uploaded	to	YouTube	How	to
Be a Successful Artist.	While
putting forward the argument
that one needs to be white to
be truly successful, he adds,
in	an	aside,	that	this	might	not
work	for	blacks	because	if	“a
nigger paints a flower it
becomes a slavery flower,
flower de Amistad,” thereby
intimating	
that	
any
relationship between the
white viewer and the black
artist immediately becomes
one between white persons
and black property, which
was the legal state of things
once upon a time, as Patricia
Williams has pointed out in
The Alchemy of Race and
Rights: “The cold game of
equality staring makes me
feel like a thin sheet of
glass.... I could force my
presence, the real me
contained	in	those	eyes,	upon
them,	but	I	would	be	smashed
in	the	process.”

Interviewed by the Brit Piers
Morgan after her 2012
Olympic victory, Serena is
informed by Morgan that he
was planning on calling her
victory dance “the Serena
Shuffle”; however, he has
learned from the American
press	that	it	is	a	Crip	Walk,	a
gangster dance. Serena
responds incredulously by
asking if she looks like a
gangster to him. Yes, he
answers. All in a day’s fun,
perhaps, and in spite and
despite	it	all,	Serena	Williams
blossoms again into Serena
Williams. When asked if she
is confident she can win her
upcoming matches, her
answer remains, “At the end
of the day, I am very happy
with me and I’m very happy
with	my	results.”
Serena would go on to win
every match she played
between	the	US	Open	and	the
year-end 2012 championship
tournament, and because
tennis is a game of
adjustments, she would do
this	without	any	reaction	to	a
number	of	questionable	calls.

More than one commentator
would remark on her ability
to hold it together during
these matches. She is a
woman	in	love,	one	suggests.
She has grown up, another
decides, as if responding to
the injustice of racism is
childish and her previous
demonstration of emotion
was	
free-floating	
and
detached from any external
actions by others. Some
others theorize she is
developing the admirable
“calm	and	measured	logic”	of
an Arthur Ashe, who the
sportswriter Bruce Jenkins
felt was “dignified” and
“courageous”	in	his	ability	to
confront injustice without
making a scene. Jenkins,
perhaps inspired by Serena’s
new	comportment,	felt	moved
to argue that her continued
boycott of Indian Wells in
2013, where she felt
traumatized	by	the	aggression
of	racist	slurs	hurled	at	her	in
2001, was lacking in
“dignity” and “integrity” and
demonstrated	
“only
stubbornness	and	a	grudge.”

Watching	
this	
newly
contained Serena, you begin
to wonder if she finally has
given	up	wanting	better	from
her peers or if she too has
come across Hennessy’s Art
Thoughtz and is channeling
his	assertion	that	the	less	that
is communicated the better.
Be ambiguous. This type of
ambiguity could also be
diagnosed	as	dissociation	and
would	support	Serena’s	claim
that she has had to split
herself off from herself and
create	different	personae.
Now that there is no calling
out	of	injustice,	no	yelling,	no
cursing,	no	finger	wagging	or
head shaking, the media
decides	to	take	up	the	mantle
when	on	December	12,	2012,
two weeks after Serena is
named WTA Player of the
Year, the Dane Caroline
Wozniacki,	a	former	number-
one	player,	imitates	Serena	by
stuffing	towels	in	her	top	and
shorts, all in good fun, at an
exhibition match. Racist?
CNN wants to know if
outrage is the proper
response.It’s then that Hennessy’s
suggestions	about	“how	to	be
a successful artist” return to
you:	be	ambiguous,	be	white.
Wozniacki, it becomes clear,
has finally enacted what was
desired by many of Serena’s
detractors, consciously or
unconsciously, the moment
the	Compton	girl	first	stepped
on court. Wozniacki (though
there	are	a	number	of	ways	to
interpret her actions—playful
mocking of a peer, imitation
of	the	mimicking	antics	of	the
tennis player known as the
joker, Novak Djokovic)
finally gives the people what
they	have	wanted	all	along	by
embodying	
Serena’s
attributes while leaving
Serena’s “angry nigger
exterior” behind. At last, in
this	real,	and	unreal,	moment,
we have Wozniacki’s image
of smiling blond goodness
posing as the best female
tennis	player	of	all	time.


You are rushing to meet a
friend	
in	
a	
distant
neighborhood of Santa
Monica. This friend says, as
you	walk	toward	her,	You	are
late, you nappy-headed ho.
What did you say? you ask,
though you have heard every
word. This person has never
before referred to you like
this in your presence, never
before code-switched in this manner. 


What did you say?
She	
doesn’t,	
perhaps
physically cannot, repeat
what	she	has	just	said.


Maybe the content of her
statement is irrelevant and
she only means to signal the
stereotype of “black people
time”	by	employing	what	she
perceives	to	be	“black	people
language.” Maybe she is
jealous of whoever kept you
and wants to suggest you are
nothing or everything to her.
Maybe she wants to have a
belated conversation about
Don Imus and the women’s
basketball team he insulted
with	this	language.	You	don’t
know. You don’t know what
she means. You don’t know
what response she expects
from	you	nor	do	you	care.	For
all	
your	
previous
understandings,	
suddenly
incoherence feels violent.

You	both	experience	this	cut,
which	she	keeps	insisting	is	a
joke, a joke stuck in her
throat, and like any other
injury, you watch it rupture
along its suddenly exposed
suture.When a woman you work
with	calls	you	by	the	name	of
another woman you work
with, it is too much of a
cliché not to laugh out loud
with the friend beside you
who says, oh no she didn’t.
Still,	in	the	end,	so	what,	who
cares? She had a fifty-fifty
chance	of	getting	it	right.


Yes, and in your mail the
apology	
note	
appears
referring to “our mistake.”
Apparently	
your	
own
invisibility	is	the	real	problem
causing	her	confusion.	This	is
how	the	apparatus	she	propels
you	into	begins	to	multiply	its
meaning.
What	did	you	say?


At the end of a brief phone
conversation, you tell the
manager you are speaking
with that you will come by
his office to sign the form.
When you arrive and
announce yourself, he blurts
out, I didn’t know you were
black!
I didn’t mean to say that, he
then	says.
Aloud,	you	say.
What?	he	asks.
You didn’t mean to say that
aloud.
Your	transaction	goes	swiftly
after	that.

And when the woman with
the multiple degrees says, I
didn’t know black women
could	get	cancer,	instinctively
you take two steps back
though	all	urgency	leaves	the
possibility of any kind of
relationship as you realize
nowhere	is	where	you	will	get
from	here.

A	friend	tells	you	he	has	seen
a photograph of you on the
Internet	and	he	wants	to	know
why you look so angry. You
and the photographer chose
the photograph he refers to
because you both decided it
looked the most relaxed. Do
you look angry? You
wouldn’t have said so.
Obviously this unsmiling
image of you makes him
uncomfortable, and he needs
you	to	account	for	that.
If you were smiling, what
would that tell him about
your composure in his
imagination?

Despite	the	fact	that	you	have
the same sabbatical schedule
as	everyone	else,	he	says,	you
are	always	on	sabbatical.	You
are friends so you respond,
easy.
What	do	you	mean?
Exactly,	what	do	you	mean?

Someone	in	the	audience	asks
the man promoting his new
book on humor what makes
something funny. His answer
is what you expect—context.
After a pause he adds that if
someone	said	something,	like
about	someone,	and	you	were
with your friends you would
probably laugh, but if they
said it out in public where
black	people	could	hear	what
was said, you might not,
probably would not. Only
then do you realize you are
among “the others out in
public” and not among
“friends.”Not long ago you are in a
room	where	someone	asks	the
philosopher Judith Butler
what	makes	language	hurtful.
You can feel everyone lean
in.	Our	very	being	exposes	us
to	the	address	of	another,	she
answers. We suffer from the
condition	
of	
being
addressable. Our emotional
openness,	she	adds,	is	carried
by	
our	
addressability.

Language	navigates	this.
For so long you thought the
ambition of racist language
was to denigrate and erase
you as a person. After
considering	Butler’s	remarks,
you begin to understand
yourself	
as	
rendered
hypervisible in the face of
such	language	acts.	Language
that feels hurtful is intended
to exploit all the ways thatyou are present. Your
alertness, your openness, and
your	desire	to	engage	actually
demand your presence, your
looking	up,	your	talking	back,
and,	as	insane	as	it	is,	saying
please.Standing	
outside	
the
conference room, unseen by
the two men waiting for the
others	to	arrive,	you	hear	one
say to the other that being
around black people is like
watching a foreign film
without translation. Because
you will spend the next two
hours around the round table
that	makes	conversing	easier,
you consider waiting a few
minutes before entering the
room.The real estate woman, who
didn’t	fathom	she	could	have
made	an	appointment	to	show
her house to you, spends
much of the walk-through
telling	
your	
friend,
repeatedly, how comfortable
she feels around her. Neither
you	nor	your	friend	bothers	to
ask who is making her feel
uncomfortable.The man at the cash register
wants to know if you think
your	card	will	work.	


If	this	is
his	routine,	he	didn’t	use	it	on
the friend who went before
you.	As	she	picks	up	her	bag,
she	looks	to	see	what	you	will
say. She says nothing. You
want her to say something—
both as witness and as a
friend. She is not you; her
silence says so. Because you
are watching all this take
place even as you participate
in	it,	you	say	nothing	as	well.
Come over here with me,
your eyes say. Why on earth
would she? The man behind
the register returns your card
and places the sandwich and
Pellegrino in a bag, which
you take from the counter.
What is wrong with you?
This question gets stuck in
your	dreams.

Another friend tells you you
have to learn not to absorb
the world. She says
sometimes she can hear her
own voice saying silently to
whomever—you are saying
this	thing	and	I	am	not	going
to accept it. Your friend
refuses to carry what doesn’t
belong	to	her.

You take in things you don’t
want	all	the	time.	The	second
you	hear	or	see	some	ordinary
moment, all its intended
targets, all the meanings
behind	the	retreating	seconds,
as far as you are able to see,
come	into	focus.	Hold	up,	did
you just hear, did you just
say,	did	you	just	see,	did	you
just do that? Then the voice
in	your	head	silently	tells	you
to take your foot off your
throat because just getting
along shouldn’t	
ambition.


To live through the days
sometimes you moan like
deer. Sometimes you sigh.
The world says stop that.
Another sigh. Another stop
that.	Moaning	elicits	laughter,
sighing upsets. Perhaps each
sigh is drawn into existence
to pull in, pull under, who
knows; truth be told, you
could no more control those
sighs than that which brings
the	sighs	about.

The sigh is the pathway to
breath; it allows breathing.
That’s just self-preservation.
No one fabricates that. You
sit	down,	you	sigh.	You	stand
up,	you	sigh.	The	sighing	is	a
worrying exhale of an ache.
You wouldn’t call it an
illness; still it is not the
iteration	of	a	free	being.	What
else to liken yourself to but
an	animal,	the	ruminant	kind?
You like to think memory
goes far back though
remembering was never
recommended.	Forget	all	that,
the world says. The world’s
had a lot of practice. No one
should	adhere	to	the	facts	that
contribute to narrative, the
facts that create lives. To
your mind, feelings are what
create a person, something
unwilling, something wild
vandalizing whatever the
skull holds. Those sensations
form a someone. The
headaches begin then. Don’t
wear	sunglasses	in	the	house,
the world says, though they
soothe, soothe sight, soothe
you.The head’s ache evaporates
into a state of numbness, a
cave of sighs. Over the years
you lose the melodrama of
seeing yourself as a patient.
The sighing ceases; the
headaches remain. You hold
your	head	in	your	hands.	You
sit still. Rarely do you lie
down.	You	ask	yourself,	how
can I help you? A glass of
water? Sunglasses? The
enteric-coated tablets live in
your purse next to your
license. The sole action is to
turn on tennis matches
without the sound. Yes, and
though	watching	tennis	isn’t	a
cure for feeling, it is a clean
displacement of effort, will,
and	disappointment.The world is wrong. You
can’t	put	the	past	behind	you.
It’s buried in you; it’s turned
your flesh into its own
cupboard. Not everything
remembered is useful but it
all comes from the world to
be stored in you. Who did
what	to	whom	on	which	day?
Who said that? She said
what? What did he just do?
Did she really just say that?
He said what? What did she
do?	Did	I	hear	what	I	think	I
heard?	Did	that	just	come	out
of	my	mouth,	his	mouth,	your
mouth? Do you remember
when	you	sighed?Memory is a tough place.
You	were	there.	If	this	is	not
the truth, it is also not a lie.
There are benefits to being
without nostalgia. Certainly
nostalgia and being without
nostalgia relieve the past.
Sitting here, there are no
memories to remember, just
the	ball	going	back	and	forth.
Shored up by this external
net,	the	problem	is	not	one	of
a lack of memories; the
problem is simply a lack, a
lack	before,	during,	and	after.
The chin and your cheek fit
into the palm of your hand.
Feeling better? The ball isn’t
being returned. Someone is
approaching the umpire.
Someone	is	upset	now.

You fumble around for the
remote to cancel mute. The
player	says	something	and	the
formerly professional umpire
looks down from her high
chair as if regarding an
unreasonable child, a small
animal. The commentator
wonders if the player will be
able	to	put	this	incident	aside.
No one can get behind the
feeling	that	caused	a	pause	in
the	match,	not	even	the	player
trying to put her feelings
behind her, dumping ball
after	ball	into	the	net.	Though
you	can	retire	with	an	injury,
you	can’t	walk	away	because
you	feel	bad.Feel good. Feel better. Move
forward. Let it go. Come on.
Come on. Come on. In due
time the ball is going back
and forth over the net. Now
the	sound	can	be	turned	back
down. Your fingers cover
your eyes, press them deep
into their sockets—too much
commotion, too much for a
head remembering to ache.
Move	on.	Let	it	go.	Come	on.

Words work as release—
well-oiled doors opening and
closing between intention,
gesture.	A	pulse	in	a	neck,	the
shiftiness of the hands, an
unconscious	
blink,	
the
conversations you have with
your	eyes	translate	everything
and nothing. What will be
needed, what goes unfelt,
unsaid—what has been
duplicated, redacted here,
redacted	there,	altered	to	hide
or disguise—words encoding
the bodies they cover. And
despite everything the body
remains.

Occasionally it is interesting
to think about the outburst if
you	would	just	cry	out—
To know what you’ll sound
like	is	worth	noting—

In the darkened moment a
body given blue light, a
flashlight, enters with levity,
with or without assumptions,
doubts, with desire, the
beating	
heart,
disappointment, with desires
—
Stand	where	you	are.

You	begin	to	move	around	in
search	of	the	steps	it	will	take
before you are thrown back
into	your	own	body,	back	into
your	own	need	to	be	found.
The destination is illusory.
You raise your lids. No one
else	is	seeking.
You	exhaust	yourself	looking
into the blue light. All day
blue	burrows	the	atmosphere.

What doesn’t belong with
you	won’t	be	seen.
You could build a world out
of need or you could hold
everything black and see.
You	give	back	the	lack.
You hold everything black.
You give yourself back until
nothing’s left but the
dissolving	blues	of	metaphor.

Sometimes	“I”	is	supposed	to
hold	what	is	not	there	until	it
is. Then what is comes apart
the	closer	you	are	to	it.
This makes the first person a
symbol	for	something.
The pronoun barely holding
the	person	together.

Someone claimed we should
use our skin as wallpaper
knowing	we	couldn’t	win.
You said “I” has so much
power;	it’s	insane.
And	you	would	look	past	me,
all gloved up, in a big coat,
with fancy fur around the
collar, and record a self
saying,	you	should	be	scared,
the	first	person	can’t	pull	you
together.

Shit, you are reading minds,
but	did	you	try?
Tried	rhyme,	tried	truth,	tried
epistolary untruth, tried and
tried.
You really did. Everyoneunderstood you to be
suffering and still everyone
thought	you	thought	you	were
the sun—never mind our
unlikeness, you too have
heard	the	noise	in	your	voice.
Anyway, sit down. Sit here
alongside.Exactly why we survive and
can look back with furrowed
brow	is	beyond	me.
It	is	not	something	to	know.
Your	ill-spirited,	cooked,	hell
on Main Street, nobody’s
here, broken-down, first
person	could	be	one	of	many
definitions of being to pass
on.

The past is a life sentence, a
blunt instrument aimed at
tomorrow.
Drag that first person out of
the social death of history,
then	we’re	kin.

Kin	calling	out	the	past	like	a
foreigner with a newly
minted	“fuck	you.”
Maybe	you	don’t	agree.
Maybe	you	don’t	think	so.
Maybe you are right, you
don’t really have anything to
confess.Why	are	you	standing?


Listen, you, I was creating a
life study of a monumental
first person, a Brahmin first
person.
If	you	need	to	feel	that	way—
still you are in here and here
is	nowhere.
Join me down here in
nowhere.

Don’t lean against the
wallpaper; sit down and pull
together.
Yours is a strange dream, a
strange	reverie.
No,	it’s	a	strange	beach;	each
body is a strange beach, and
if you let in the excess
emotion you will recall the
Atlantic Ocean breaking on
our	heads.Yesterday called to say we
were together and you were
bloodshot and again the day
carried you across a field of
hours, deep into dawn, back
to now, where you are
thankful	for
what faces you, the storm,
this day’s sigh as the day
shifts its leaves, the wind, a
prompt against the calm you
can’t	digest.

Blue ceiling calling a body
into the midst of azure,
oceanic,	as	ocean	blushes	the
blues it can’t absorb,
reflecting	back	a	day
the	day	frays,	night,	not	night,
this fright passes through the
eye crashing into you, is this
you?

Yes, it’s me, clear the way,
then	hold	me	clear	of	this	that
faces, the storm carrying me
through	dawn
not	knowing	whether	to	climb
down	or	up	into	its	eye—day,
hearing a breath shiver,
whose	are	you?Guard rail, spotlight, safety
lock, airbag, fire lane, slip
guard, night watch, far into
this	day	are	the	days	this	day
was meant to take out of its
way.	An	obstacle
to surrender, dusk in dawn,
held open, then closing, then
opening, a red-tailed hawk,
dusk at dawn, taking over
blue, surveying movement,
against the calm, red sky at
morning,
whose	are	you?

In line at the drugstore it’s
finally	your	turn,	and	then	it’s
not as he walks in front of
you	and	puts	his	things	on	the
counter.	The	cashier	says,	Sir,
she was next. When he turns
to	you	he	is	truly	surprised.
Oh	my	God,	I	didn’t	see	you.

You must be in a hurry, you
offer.
No,	no,	no,	I	really	didn’t	see
you.You wait at the bar of the
restaurant for a friend, and a
man, wanting to make
conversation,	
nursing
something, takes out his
phone to show you a picture
of his wife. You say, bridge
that she is, that she is
beautiful. She is, he says,
beautiful	and	black,	like	you.

Leaving	the	day	to	itself,	you
close	the	door	behind	you	and
pour a bowl of cereal, then
another, and would a third if
you didn’t interrupt yourself
with the statement—you
aren’t	hungry.
Appetite won’t attach you to
anything no matter how
depleted	you	feel.It’s	true.
You lean against the sink, a
glass of red wine in your
hand and then another,
thinking in the morning you
will go to the gym having
slept and slept beyond the
residuals	of	all	yesterdays.
Yes, and you do go to the
gym and run in place, an
entire hour running, just you
and
your body running off each
undesired	desired	encounter.


Hours later, still in the
difficulty of what it is to be,
just like that, inside it,
standing	
there,	
maybe
wading, maybe waving,
standing where the deep
waters of everything backed
up, one said, climbing over
bodies, one said, stranded on
a roof, one said, trapped in
the building, and in the
difficulty, nobody coming
and	still	someone	saying,	who
could see it coming, the
difficulty	of	that.
The fiction of the facts
assumes	
innocence,
ignorance, lack of intention,
misdirection; the necessary
conditions of a certain time
and	place.
Have	you	seen	their	faces?

Faith, not fear, she said.
She’d heard that once and
was trying to stamp the
phrase on her mind. At the
time, she couldn’t speak it
aloud.	He	wouldn’t	tolerate	it.
He was angry. Where were
they? Where was anyone?
This	
is	
a	
goddamn
emergency,	he	said.

Then someone else said it
was the classic binary
between the rich and the
poor, between the haves and
the have-nots, between the
whites and the blacks, in the
difficulty	of	all	that.

Then each house was a
mumbling structure, all that
water, buildings peeling
apart, the yellow foam, the
contaminated	
drawl	
of
mildew,	mold.
The missing limbs, he said,
the bodies lodged in piles of
rubble,	dangling	from	rafters,
lying	
facedown,	
armsoutstretched	on	parlor	floors.

And someone said, where
were the buses? And
simultaneously someone else
said, FEMA said it wasn’t
safe	to	be	there.
What I’m hearing, she said,
which	is	sort	of	scary,	is	they
all	want	to	stay	in	Texas.

He gave me the flashlight,
she	said,	I	didn’t	want	to	turn
it	on.	It	was	all	black.	I	didn’t
want	to	shine	a	light	on	that.
We never reached out to
anyone to tell our story,
because there’s no ending to
our story, he said. Being
honest with you, in my
opinion,	they	forgot	about	us

It’s awful, she said, to go
back home to find your own
dead	child.	It’s	really	sad.

And	so	many	of	the	people	in
the	arena	here,	you	know,	she
said, were underprivileged
anyway, so this is working
very	well	for	them.
You simply get chills every
time you see these poor
individuals,	so	many	of	these
people	almost	all	of	them	that
we	see,	are	so	poor,	someone
else said, and they are so
black.

Have	you	seen	their	faces?
Then this aestheticized
distancing from Oh my God,
from unbelievable, from
dehydration,	
from
overheating,	
from	
no
electricity,	no	power,	no	way
to	communicate
we	are	drowning	here
still	in	the	difficulty
as if the faces in the images
hold	all	the	consequences
and the fiction of the facts
assumes randomness and
indeterminacy.

He said, I don’t know what
the water wanted. It wanted
to show you no one would
come.He said, I don’t know what
the water wanted. As if then
and now were not the same
moment.
He said, I don’t know what
the	water	wanted.
Call	out	to	them.
I	don’t	see	them.Call	out	anyway.
Did	you	see	their	faces?

My brothers are notorious.
They	have	not	been	to	prison.
They have been imprisoned.
The	prison	is	not	a	place	you
enter. It is no place. My
brothers are notorious. They
do regular things, like wait.
On my birthday they say my
name. They will never forget
that we are named. What is
that	memory?The days of our childhood
together	were	steep	steps	into
a collapsing mind. It looked
like we rescued ourselves,
were rescued. Then there are
these days, each day of our
adult lives. They will never
forget	our	way	through,	these
brothers, each brother, my
brother, dear brother, my
dearest	brothers,	dear	heart—
Your hearts are broken. This
is not a secret though there
are secrets. And as yet I do
not understand how my own
sorrow has turned into my
brothers’	hearts.	The	hearts	of
my brothers are broken. If I
knew another way to be, I
would call up a brother, I
would	hear	myself	saying,	my
brother, dear brother, my
dearest	brothers,	dear	heart—
On the tip of a tongue one
note following another is
another path, another dawn
where the pink sky is the
bloodshot of struck, of
sleepless, of sorry, of
senseless, shush. Those years
of and before me and my
brothers,	the	years	of	passage,
plantation, migration, of Jim
Crow	segregation,	of	poverty,
inner cities, profiling, of one
in three, two jobs, boy, hey
boy, each a felony,
accumulate into the hours
inside	our	lives	where	we	are
all caught hanging, the rope
inside us, the tree inside us,
its roots our limbs, a throat
sliced through and when we
open our mouth to speak,
blossoms, o blossoms, no
place coming out, brother,
dear brother, that kind of
blue.	The	sky	is	the	silence	of
brothers all the days leading
up	to	my	call.

If I called I’d say good-bye
before	I	broke	the	good-bye.	I
say good-bye before anyone
can hang up. Don’t hang up.
My brother hangs up though
he is there. I keep talking.
The	talk	keeps	him	there.	The
sky	is	blue,	kind	of	blue.	The
day	is	hot.	Is	it	cold?	Are	you
cold? It does get cool. Is it
cool?	Are	you	cool?
My brother is completed by
sky.	

 The sky is his silence.
Eventually, he says, it is
raining. It is raining down. It
was raining. It stopped
raining.	It	is	raining	down.	He
won’t hang up. He’s there,
he’s there but he’s hung up
though	he	is	there.	Good-bye,
I	say.	I	break	the	good-bye.	I
say good-bye before anyone
can hang up, don’t hang up.
Wait with me. Wait with me
though the waiting might be
the	call	of	good-byes

In the next frame the pickup
truck	is	in	motion.	Its	motion
activates its darkness. The
pickup	truck	is	a	condition	of
darkness in motion. It makes
a dark subject. You mean a
black subject. No, a black
object.Then	the	pickup	is	beating	the
black object to the ground
and	the	tire	marks	the	crushed
organs. Then the audio, I ran
that nigger over, is itself a
record-breaking hot June day
in	the	twenty-first	century.
The pickup returns us to live
cruelty, like sunrise, red
streaks falling from dawn to
asphalt—then again this
pickup is not about beauty.
It’s	a	pure	product.
The	announcer	patronizes	the
pickup truck, no hoodlums,
“just teens,” no gang, “just a
teen,” “with straggly blond
hair,” “a slight blond man.”
The pickup is human in this
predictable way. Do you
recognize	yourself,	Dedmon?

In the circulating photo you
are looking down. Were you
dreaming of this day all the
days of your youth? In the
daydream	did	the	pickup	take
you home? Was it a pickup
fueling the road to I ran that
nigger	over?
Baldwin says skin color
cannot be more important
than the human being. And
was the pickup constructing

or	exploding	whiteness	out	of
you? You are so sorry. You
are	angry,	an	explosive	anger,
an effective one: I ran that
nigger	over.James Craig Anderson is
dead. The pickup truck is a
figure of speech. It is as the
crown standing in for the
kingdom. Who told you it
was	a	crown?	Did	we	tell	you
the pickup was as good as
home? You are so young,
Dedmon.	You	were	so	young
 is
dead. What ails you,
Dedmon? What up? What’s
up is James Craig Anderson
is dead. So sorry. So angry,
an imploding anger. It must
let	you	go.	It	let	you	go


As he walked across grass
still green from summer
walking	out	of	the	rain	a	step
beyond into a piece of sky
dry all day for him in this
moment a shelter as he sat
beneath the overhanging
branches of the “white tree”
surprising himself at the
center of the school yard
thinking of the slight give in
the cushions of the counter
seats he had read about in
textbooks	did	the	hardness	of
the	ground	cross	the	hardness
of the seats in buses as he
waited	to	be	noticed	listening
to the lift and fall of the
leaves	above	him?
As the boys walked across
grass a darkening wave as
dusk folded into night
walking toward a dawn sunpunching	
through	
the
blackness as they noosed the
rope looped around the
overhanging	branches	of	their
tree surprising themselves at
the center of the school yard
thinking	this	is	how	they	will
learn the ropes did the
hardness	in	the	history	books
cross the hardness in their
eyes all the eyes with that
look without give did they
give that look to the lift and
fall	of	the	leaves	above	them?

At the high school party the
boy turned to the boys as
boys do walking into a fist
punching	
through	
the
blackness as glass shattered
light	knocked	conscious	blunt
breathing	
bruising	
the
refusing boy surrounded by
blows taking custody of his
body bodying forth against a
boyhood defining it by
fighting through this body
propelled forward and back
bearing until the beer bottle
shattered hardness bruising
the refusal leveled without
give.
When the boys turned the
corner was inflammation in
the air already forming
knuckles as they pummeled
the body being kicked and
beaten	
until	
knocked
unconscious his right eye
closed shut blood refusing to
clot flowing from both ears
were they hearing their own
breathing their own ears
allowing their blows to take
custody of this body fallen
against the hardness of the
concrete	floor	leveled	without
give?

Boys	will	be	boys	being	boys
feeling	their	capacity	heaving
butting heads righting their
wrongs in the violence of
aggravated	
adolescence
charging	forward	in	their	way
experiencing the position of
positioning which is a
position for only one kind of
boy face it know it for the
other boy for the other boys
the fists the feet criminalized
already are weapons already
exploding the landscape and
then	the	litigious	hitting	back
is	life	imprisoned.


I	knew	whatever	was	in	front
of me was happening and
then the police vehicle came
to	a	screeching	halt	in	front	of
me	like	they	were	setting	up	a
blockade. Everywhere were
flashes, a siren sounding and
a stretched-out roar. Get on
the	ground.	Get	on	the	ground
now.	Then	I	just	knew.


And you are not the guy and
still you fit the description
because	there	is	only	one	guy
who	is	always	the	guy	fitting
the	description.

I left my client’s house
knowing I would be pulled
over. I knew. I just knew. I
opened my briefcase on the
passenger seat, just so they
could see. Yes officer rolled
around on my tongue, which
grew out of a bell that could
never ring because its
emergency was a tolling I
was	meant	to	swallow.
In	a	landscape	drawn	from	an
ocean bed, you can’t drive
yourself sane—so angry you
are crying. You can’t drive
yourself sane. This motion
wears a guy out. Our motion
is wearing you out and still
you	are	not	that	guy.

Then flashes, a siren, a
stretched-out roar—and you
are not the guy and still you
fit the description because
there is only one guy who is
always the guy fitting the
description.
Get	on	the	ground.	Get	on	the
ground now. I must have
been speeding. No, youweren’t speeding. 

I wasn’t
speeding? You didn’t do
anything wrong. Then why
are you pulling me over?
Why am I pulled over? Put
your	hands	where	they	can	be
seen. Put your hands in the
air.	Put	your	hands	up.
Then	you	are	stretched	out	on
the	hood.	Then	cuffed.	Get	on
the	ground	now.Each time it begins in the
same way, it doesn’t begin
the same way, each time it
begins	it’s	the	same.	Flashes,
a	siren,	the	stretched-out	roar
—
Maybe because home was a
hood the officer could not
afford, not that a reason was
needed, I was pulled out of
my vehicle a block from my
door, handcuffed and pushed
into the police vehicle’s
backseat, the officer’s knee
pressing into my collarbone,
the officer’s warm breath
vacating a face creased into
the smile of its own private
joke.

Each time it begins in the
same way, it doesn’t begin
the same way, each time it
begins	it’s	the	same.

Go	
ahead	
hit	
me
motherfucker fled my lips
and	the	officer	did	not	need	to
hit me, the officer did not
need anything from me
except	the	look	on	my	face	on
the drive across town. You
can’t	drive	yourself	sane.	You
are	not	insane.	Our	motion	is
wearing	you	out.	You	are	not
the	guy.

This	is	what	it	looks	like.	You
know this is wrong. This is
not what it looks like. You
need to be quiet. This is
wrong. You need to close
your	mouth	now.	This	is	what
it looks like. Why are you
talking if you haven’t done
anything	wrong?
And you are not the guy and
still you fit the description
because	there	is	only	one	guy
who	is	always	the	guy	fitting
the	description.

In	a	landscape	drawn	from	an
ocean bed, you can’t drive
yourself sane—so angry you
can’t	drive	yourself	sane.
The charge the officer
decided on was exhibition of
speed. I was told, after the
fingerprinting,	to	stand	naked.
I stood naked. It was only
then	I	was	instructed	to	dress,
to leave, to walk all those
miles	back	home.
And still you are not the guy
and still you fit the
description because there is
only one guy who is always
the	guy	fitting	the	description.

And yes, the inaudible
spreads	across	state	lines.
Its call backing away from
the	face	of	America.
Bloodshot eyes calling onAmerica
that can’t look forward for
being	called	back.
America turned loose on
America—
All living is listening for a
throat	to	open—The length of its silence
shaping	lives.
When	he	opened	his	mouth	to
speak, his speech was what
was	written	in	the	silence,
the length of the silence
becoming	a	living.

And	what	had	been
“I do solemnly swear that I
will	faithfully
execute the office of
President	of	the	United	States
...”
becomes“I do solemnly swear that I
will	execute
the office of President to the
United	States	faithfully	...”

Though	this	house	in	London
has been remodeled, the
stairs,	despite	being	carpeted,
creak.	What	was	imagined	as
a	silent	retreat	from	the	party
seems to sound through the
house. By the fifth step you
decide	to	sit	down	and	on	the
wall next to you is a torn
passport photo of half a
woman’s face blown up and
framed	as	art.	Where	did	you
imagine	you	were	going?	you
say	aloud	to	her.

“The purpose of art,” James
Baldwin	wrote,	“is	to	lay	bare
the questions hidden by the
answers.” He might have
been	
channeling
Dostoyevsky’s statement that
“we	have	all	the	answers.	It	is
the questions we do not
know.”Where can I imagine you
have	been?
A man, a novelist with the
face of the English sky—full
of weather, always in
response, constantly shifting,
clouding over only to clear
briefly—stands before you,
his head leaning against the
same	wall	as	the	torn-up	girl.
You begin discussing the
recent riots in Hackney.

Despite what is being said
you get lost in his face, his
responsiveness bringing what
reads	as	intimacy	to	his	eyes.
He	says	the	riots	were	similar
to	the	Rodney	King–LA	riots;
however, he feels the UK
media handled them very
differently from the US
media.
The Hackney riots began at
the end of the summer of
2011 when Mark Duggan, a
black man, a husband, a
father, and a suspected drug
dealer, was shot dead by
officers	from	Scotland	Yard’s
Operation Trident (a special
operations unit addressing
gun	
crime	
in	
black
communities). As the rioting
and	
looting	
continued,
government officials labeled
the	
violent	
outbreak
“opportunism” and “sheer
criminality,” and the media
picked up this language.

Whatever the reason for the
riots, images of the looters’
continued	rampage	eventually
displaced the fact that an
unarmed man was shot to
death.

In the United States, Rodney
King’s beating, caught on
video, trumped all other
images. If there had been a
video of Duggan being
executed, there might be less
ambiguity around what
started the riots, you hazard
to	say.
Will you write about
Duggan? the man wants to
know. Why don’t you? you
ask. Me? he asks, looking
slightly	irritated.

How difficult is it for one
body to feel the injustice
wheeled at another? Are the
tensions,	the	recognitions,	the
disappointments, and the
failures that exploded in the
riots	too	foreign?
A similar accumulation and
release	
drove	
many
Americans to respond to the
Rodney	King	beating.	Before
it happened, it had happened
and happened. As a black
body in the States, your
response	was	necessary	if	you
were	to	hold	on	to	the	fiction
that this was an event
“wrongfully	
ordinary,”

therefore a snafu within the
ordinary.

Though the moment had
occurred and occurred again
with	the	deaths,	beatings,	and
imprisonment	
of	
other
random, unarmed black men,
Rodney King’s beating
somehow cut off the air
supply	in	the	US	body	politic
by virtue of the excessive,
blatant	barrage	of	racism	and
compromised justice that
followed on the heels of his
beating. And though in this
man’s	body,	the	man	made	of
English sky, grief exists for
Duggan as a black man
gunned	down,	there	is	not	the
urgency brought on by an
overflow of compromises,
deaths, and tempers specific
to	a	profile	woke	to	and	gone
to	sleep	to	each	day.

Arguably, there is no
simultaneity between the
English sky and the body
being	ordered	to	rest	in	peace.
This difference, which has to
do with “the war (the black
body’s)	
presence	
has
occasioned,”	
to	
quote
Baldwin, makes all the
difference.	One	could	become
acquainted	
with	
the
inflammation that existed
around	Duggan’s	body	and	it
would be uncomfortable.

Grief	
comes	
out	
of
relationships to subjects over
time	and	not	to	any	subject	in
theory, you tell the English
sky, to give him an out. The
distance between you and
him is thrown into relief:
bodies moving through the
same life differently. With
your eyes wide open you
consider what this man and
you, two middle-aged artists,
in	a	house	worth	more	than	a
million pounds, share with
Duggan. Mark Duggan, you
are part of the misery.

Apparently your new friend
won’t write about Mark
Duggan or the London riots;
still you continue searching
his face because there is
something to find, an answer
to	question.

Something is there before us
that is neither the living
person	himself	nor	any	sort	of
reality, neither the same as
the one who is alive, nor
another.
What is there is the absolute
calm of what has found its place.

Every day I think about
where	I	came	from	and	I	am
still	proud	to	be	who	I	am	...

	

Perhaps the most insidious
and least understood form of
segregation is that of the
word.

The Algerian men, for their
part, are a target of criticism
for	their	European	comrades.
Arise directly to the level of
tragedy.Notice too, illustrations of
this kind of racial prejudice
can	be	multiplied	indefinitely.
Clearly,	the	Algerians	who,	in
view of the intensity of the
repression and the frenzied
character of the oppression,
thought	they	could	answer	the
blows received without any
serious	
problem	
of
conscience.	

And there is no
 who
has not felt, briefly or for
long periods, with anguish
sharp or dull, in varying
degrees	and	to	varying	effect,
simple,	
naked,	
and
unanswerable	hatred;	who	has
not wanted to smash any
white face he may encounter
in a day, to violate, out of
motives of the cruelest
vengeance ... to break the
bodies	of	all	white	people	and
bring	them	low,	as	low	as	the
dust into which he himself
has been and is being
trampled; no black who has
not had to make his own
precarious adjustment ... yet
the	adjustment	must	be	made
—rather	it	must	be	attempted.

Do you think two minutes
from	the	end	of	a	World	Cup
final, two minutes from the
end	of	my	career,	I	wanted	to
do	that?	

Each	decision	gave	rise	to	the
same hesitations, produced
the	same	despair.

No	one	is	free.
For	all	that	he	is,	people	will
say he remains for us an
Arab. “You can’t get away
from	nature.”	

Let him do his spite: My
services	which	I	have	done	...
Shall	
out-tongue	
his
complaints.	

When	such	things	happen,	he
must	grit	his	teeth,	walk	away
a few steps, elude the
passerby	who	draws	attention
to him, who gives other
passersby the desire either to
follow the example or to
come to his defense. 


That	man	who	is	forced	each
day to snatch his manhood,
his	identity,	out	of	the	fire	of
human cruelty that rages to
destroy it, knows ...
something about himself and
human life that no school on
earth—and	indeed,	no	church
—can teach. He achieves his
own authority, and that is
unshakable.

This is because, in order to
save his life, he is forced to
look beneath appearances, to
take nothing for granted, to
hear the meaning behind the
words.
We hear, then we remember.


The state of emergency is
also always a state of
emergence.	

But at this moment—from
whence came the spirit I
don’t know—

I resolved to
fight; and, suiting my action
to the resolution ...


what	we	have	here	is	not	the
bringing to light of a
character	
known	
and
frequented a thousand times
in the imagination or in
stories.

It is the White Man who
creates the black man. But it
is	the	black	man	who	creates.

This thing was there, we
grasped it in the living
motion.	
What he said “touched the
deepest part of me.”

The rebuttal assumes an
original	form.This endless struggle to
achieve and reveal and
confirm a human identity,
human	authority,	contains,	for
all its horror, something very
beautiful.	

Making	Room
Script for Public Fiction at
Hammer	MuseumOn the train the woman
standing	
makes	
you
understand there are no seats
available. And, in fact, there
is one. Is the woman getting
off at the next stop? No, she
would	rather	stand	all	the	way
to	Union	Station.
The space next to the man is
the pause in a conversation
you are suddenly rushing to
fill.	You	step	quickly	over	the
woman’s fear, a fear she
shares.	You	let	her	have	it.
The	
man	
doesn’t
acknowledge you as you sit
down	because	the	man	knows
more about the unoccupied
seat than you do. For him,
you imagine, it is more like
breath than wonder; he has
had	to	think	about	it	so	much
you	wouldn’t	call	it	thought.

When another passenger
leaves his seat and the
standing woman sits, you
glance	over	at	the	man.	He	is
gazing out the window into
what	looks	like	darkness.

You	sit	next	to	the	man	on	the
train, bus, in the plane,
waiting room, anywhere he
could be forsaken. You put
your body there in proximity
to, adjacent to, alongside,
within.
You don’t speak unless you
are spoken to and your body
speaks to the space you fill
and you keep trying to fill it
except the space belongs to
the body of the man next to
you,	not	to	you.

Where he goes the space
follows him. If the man left
his seat before Union Station
you	would	simply	be	a	person
in a seat on the train. You
would cease to struggle
against the unoccupied seat
when where why the space
won’t	lose	its	meaning.
You	imagine	if	the	man	spoke
to you he would say, it’s
okay, I’m okay, you don’t

need to sit here. You don’t
need to sit and you sit and
look past him into the
darkness the train is moving
through.	A	tunnel.
All the while the darkness
allows you to look at him.
Does he feel you looking at
him? You suspect so. What
does suspicion mean? What
does	suspicion	do?

The soft gray-green of your
cotton	coat	touches	the	sleeve
of him. You are shoulder to
shoulder	though	standing	you
could feel shadowed. You sit
to repair whom who? You
erase that thought. And it
might	be	too	late	for	that.
It	might	forever	be	too	late	or
too	early.	The	train	moves	too
fast	for	your	eyes	to	adjust	to
anything	beyond	the	man,	the
window, the tiled tunnel, its
slick darkness. Occasionally,
a	white	light	flickers	by	like	a
displaced	sound.

From across the aisle tracks
room harbor world a woman
asks	a	man	in	the	rows	ahead
if he would mind switching
seats. She wishes to sit with
her	daughter	or	son.	You	hear
but	you	don’t	hear.	You	can’t
see.It’s	then	the	man	next	to	you
turns to you. And as if from
inside your own head you
agree	that	if	anyone	asks	you
to move, you’ll tell them we
are	traveling	as	a	family.

 In
 The
Justice	System

some years there exists a
wanting	to	escape—
you, floating above your
certain	ache—
still	the	ache	coexists.
Call	that	the	immanent	you—


You	are	you	even	before	you
grow	into	understanding	you
are	not	anyone,	worthless,
not	worth	you.
Even as your own weight
insists
you	are	here,	fighting	off
the	weight	of	nonexistence.

And still this life parts your
lids,	you	see
you seeing your extending
hand
as	a	falling	wave—

I	they	he	she	we	you	turn
only	to	discover
the	encounter
to	be	alien	to	this	place.
Wait.
The patience is in the living.

Time	opens	out	to	you.
The opening, between you
and	you,	occupied,
zoned	for	an	encounter,
given	the	histories	of	you	and
you—
And	always,	who	is	this	you?

The	start	of	you,	each	day,
a	presence	already—
Hey	you—Slipping down burying the
you buried within. You are
everywhere and you are
nowhere	in	the	day.
The	outside	comes	in—
Then	you,	hey	you—

Overheard	in	the	moonlight.
Overcome	in	the	moonlight.

Soon you are sitting around,
publicly listening, when you
hear this—what happens to
you doesn’t belong to you,
only	half	concerns	you.	He	is
speaking of the legionnaires
in Claire Denis’s film Beau


Travail and you are pulled
back into the body of you
receiving	the	nothing	gaze—
The world out there insisting
on this only half concerns
you. What happens to you
doesn’t belong to you, only
half concerns you. It’s not
yours.	Not	yours	only.

And still a world begins its
furious	erasure—
Who do you think you are,
saying	I	to	me?
You	nothing.
You	nobody.You.
A body in the world drowns
in	it—
Hey	you—
All	our	fevered	history	won’t
instill	insight,
won’t	turn	a	body	conscious,

won’t	make	that	look
in the eyes say yes, though
there	is	nothing
to	solve
even as each moment is an
answer.Don’t say I if it means so
little,
holds the little forming no
one.
You are not sick, you are
injured—
you	ache	for	the	rest	of	life.

How to care for the injured
body,
the kind of body that can’t
hold
the	content	it	is	living?
And	where	is	the	safest	place
when	that	place
must	be	someplace	other	than
in	the	body?Even now your voice
entangles	this	mouth
whose words are here as
pulse,	strumming
shut	out,	shut	in,	shut	up—
You	cannot	say—
A	body	translates	its	you—
you	there,	hey	you

even	as	it	loses	the	location	of
its	mouth.
When you lay your body in
the	body
entered as if skin and bone
were	public	places,
when you lay your body in
the	body
entered as if you’re theground	you	walk	on,
you	know	no	memory	should
live
in	these	memories
becoming	the	body	of	you.
You slow all existence down
with	your	call
detectable only as sky. The
night’s	yawn
absorbs you as you lie down
at	the	wrong	angle
to	the	sun	ready	already	to	let
go	of	your	hand.

Wait	with	me
though	the	waiting,	wait	up,
might take until nothing
whatsoever	was	done.

To	be	left,	not	alone,	the	only
wish—
to call you out, to call out
you.
Who	shouted,	you?	You
shouted	you,	you	the	murmur

in the air, you sometimes
sounding like you, you
sometimes	saying	you,
go	nowhere,
be	no	one	but	you	first—
Nobody notices, only you’ve
known,you’re	not	sick,	not	crazy,
not	angry,	not	sad—
It’s	just	this,	you’re	injured.

Everything	shaded	everything
darkened	
everything
shadowed
is	the	stripped	is	the	struck—
is	the	trace
is	the	aftertaste.

I	they	he	she	we	you	were	too
concluded yesterday to know
whatever	was	done	could	also
be done, was also done, was
never	done—
The worst injury is feeling
you	don’t	belong	so	much
to	you—

When	the	waitress	hands	your
friend	the	card	she	took	from
you, you laugh and ask what
else her privilege gets her?
Oh, my perfect life, she
answers. Then you both are
laughing	so	hard,	everyone	in
the	restaurant	smiles.

Closed to traffic, the
previously	
unexpressive
street fills with small bodies.
One father, having let go of
his	child’s	hand,	stands	on	the
steps of a building and
watches.	You	can’t	tell	which
child is his, though you
follow his gaze. It seems to
belong	to	all	the	children	as	it
envelops	their	play.	You	were
about to enter your building,

but do not want to leave the
scope	of	his	vigilance.

A friend writes of the
numbing effects of humming
and it returns you to your
own sigh. It’s no longer
audible. You’ve grown into
it. Some call it aging—an
internalized liquid smoke
blurring	ordinary	ache.
Just this morning another,
What	did	he	say?

Come	on,	get	back	in	the	car.
Your	partner	wants	to	face	off
with	a	mouth	and	who	knows
what handheld objects the
other	vehicle	carries.
Trayvon Martin’s name
sounds from the car radio a
dozen times each half hour.
You pull your love back into
the seat because though no
one	seems	to	be	chasing	you,
the justice system has other

plans.
Yes,	and	this	is	how	you	are	a
citizen: Come on. Let it go.
Move	on.
Despite the air-conditioning
you pull the button back and
the window slides down into
its door-sleeve. A breeze
touches your cheek. As
something	should.

What	feels	more	than	feeling?
You are afraid there is
something you are missing,
something	obvious.	A	feeling
that feelings might be
irrelevant if they point to
one’s	irrelevance	pulls	at	you.
Do feelings lose their feeling
if they speak to a lack of
feeling? Can feelings be a

hazard, a warning sign, a
disturbance, distaste, the
disgrace? Don’t feel like you
are mistaken. It’s not that (Is
it not that?) you are
oversensitive	
or
misunderstanding.
You	
know	
feelings
destabilize since everyone
you ask is laughing that kind
of close-the-gap laughter: all
the	
ha-ha’s	
wanting

uninterrupted	views.	Don’t	be
ridiculous. None of the other
black friends feel that way
and	how	you	feel	is	how	you
feel	even	if	what	you	perceive
isn’t	tied	to	what	is	...
What	is?

And so it goes until the vista
includes	only	displacement	of
feeling back into the body,
which gave birth to the
feelings that don’t sit
comfortably	
inside	
the
communal.
You smile dumbly at the
world because you are still
feeling if only the feeling
could be known and this
brings on the moment you
recognize	as	desire.

Every day your mouth opens
and receives the kiss the
world	offers,	which	seals	you
shut though you are feeling
sick to your stomach about
the beginning of the feeling
that was born from
understanding and now
stumbles around in you—the
go-along-to-get-along tongue
pushing your tongue aside.

Yes, and your mouth is full
up and the feeling is still
tottering—

“The	subject	of	so	many	films
is	the	protection	of	the	victim,
and I think, I don’t give a
damn about those things. It’s
not the job of films to nurse
people.	

With	
what’s
happening	in	the	chemistry	of
love, I don’t want to be a
nurse	or	a	doctor,	I	just	want
to	be	an	observer.”

As a child, Claire Denis
wished to be a nurse; she is
no	longer	a	child.	Years	have
passed and so soon we love
this world, so soon we are
willing	to	coexist	with	dust	in
our	eyes.And,	of	course,	you	want	the
days to add up to something
more	than	you	came	in	out	of
the	sun	and	drank	the	potable
water of your developed
world—
yes, and because words hang
in the air like pollen, the
throat	closes.	You	hack	away.

That time and that time and
that	time	the	outside	blistered
the inside of you, words
outmaneuvered years, had
you in a chokehold, every
part roughed up, the eyes
dripping.

That’s the bruise the ice in
the	heart	was	meant	to	ice.
To arrive like this every day
for	it	to	be	like	this	to	have	so
many	memories	and	no	other
memory than these for as
long as they can be
remembered to remember
this.

Though a share of all
remembering, a measure of
all memory, is breath and to
breathe you have to create a
truce—a	truce	with	the	patience	of	a
stethoscope.

I	can	hear	the	even	breathing
that creates passages to
dreams. 

And yes, I want to
interrupt to tell him her us
you me I don’t know how to
end what doesn’t have an
ending.

Tell me a story, he says,
wrapping his arms around
me.Yesterday, I begin, I was
waiting in the car for time to
pass.	A	woman	pulled	in	and
started to park her car facing
mine.	

Our	eyes	met	and	what
passed passed as quickly as
the	look	away.	She	backed	up
and parked on the other side
of the lot. I could have
followed her to worry my
question but I had to go, I
was expected on court, I
grabbed	my	racket.

The sunrise is slow and
cloudy, dragging the light in,
but	barely.

Did	you	win?	he	asks.
It wasn’t a match, I say. It
was	a	lesson.
