 Are you such a dreamer? 
To put the world to rights? 
I'll stay home forever 
Where two & two always 
makes up five 
 
I'll lay down the tracks 
Sandbag & hide 
January has April's showers 
And two & two always 
makes up five 
 
It's the devil's way now 
There is no way out 
You can scream & you 
can shout 
It is too late now 
Because 
 
You have not been 
paying attention 
 
I try to sing along 
I get it all wrong 
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee 
NOT 
I swat em like flies but 
Like flies the burgers 
Keep coming back 
NOT 
Maybe not 
 All hail to the thief 
 But I am not! 
 Don't question my authority 
or put me in the dock 
Cozimnot! 
Go & tell the king that 
The sky is falling in 
When it's not 
Maybe not. 
 
(ahh diddums.) 
 


 


A PUNCHUP AT A WEDDING

 no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no 
i don't know why you bother 
nothing's ever good enough for you 
i was there and it wasn't like that 
you came here just to start a fight 
 
you had to piss on our parade 
you had to shred our big day 
you had to ruin it for all concerned 
in a drunken punchup at a wedding. 
 
hypocrite opportunist 
don't infect me with your poison 
a bully in a china shop 
when i turn round stay frozen to the spot. 
 
you had to piss on our parade 
you had to shred our big day 
you had to ruin it for all concerned 
in a drunken punchup at a wedding. 
 
the pointless snide remarks 
of hammerheaded sharks 
the pot will call the kettle black 
 
in a drunken punchup at a wedding. 
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no 


 


A REMINDER

 If I get old, I will not give in 
But if I do, remind me of this. 
Remind me that, once I was free, 
Once I was cool, once I was me. 
And if I sat down, and crossed my arms, 
Hold me into, this song. 
Knock me out, smash out my brains, 
If I take a chair, start to talk shit..... 
If I get old, remind me of this: 
That night we kissed, and I really meant it. 
 
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking. 
Pick up the phone, play me this song.

 


AIRBAG

 In the next world war 
in a jack knifed juggernaut 
I am born again 
In the neon sign scrolling up and down 
I am born again 
 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe 
 
In a deep deep sleep of the innocent I am born again 
In a fast german car I'm amazed that I survived 
An airbag saved my life 
 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe

 


AMNESIAC / MORNING BELL

 Morning bell Morning bell Light another candle Release me Release me You can keep the furniture A bump on the head Coming down the chimney Release me Release me Yeah.. Release me Release me Where'd you park the car? Where'd you park the car? Clothes are all over the furniture And I might as well I might as well Sleepy jack the fire drill Run around around around around around.. Cut the kids in half Cut the kids in half Cut the kids in half 


ANYONE CAN PLAY GUITAR

 Destiny... 
destiny protect me from the world 
Destiny... 
hold my hand, protect me from the world 
 
Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 
 
As the world does turn 
And if London burns 
I'll be standing on the beach 
with my guitar 
I wanna be in a band 
When I get to heaven 
Anyone can play guitar and they won't 
be a nothing anymore 
 
Grow my hair... 
grow my hair 
I am Jim Morrison 
Grow my hair... 
I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison 
 
Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 
 
As the world does turn 
And if London burns 
I'll be standing on the beach 
with my guitar 
I wanna be in a band 
When I get to heaven 
Anyone can play guitar and they won't 
be a nothing anymore

 


BACKDRIFTS

 We're rotten fruit 
We're damaged goods 
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose 
One gust and we will probably crumble 
We're backdrifters 
 
This far but no further 
I'm hanging off a branch 
I'm teetering on the brink 
Oh honey sweet 
So full of sleep 
I'm backsliding 
 
You fell into our arms 
You fell into our arms 
We tried but there was nothing we could do 
Nothing we could do 
 
All evidence has been buried 
All tapes have been erased 
But your footsteps give you away 
So you're backtracking 
 
Ah ah ah 
You fell into our arms 
You fell into our arms 
We tried but there was nothing we could do 
Nothing we could do 
You fell into our, ah 
You fell into a 
 
We're rotten fruit 
We're damaged goods 
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose 
One gust and we will probably crumble 
We're backdrifters 


 


BANANA CO.

 Oh, banana co. 
We really love you and we need you 
And oh, banana co. 
We'd really love to believe you, but 
Everything's underground 
We gotta dig it up somehow 
Yeah yeah 
 
Oh, she said no go 
She said she'd like to 
She's seen you 
But no, no ho go 
She says if you die then we all do 
Everything's burning down 
We gotta dig it up somehow 
Yeah yeah 
 
And everything's underground 
We gotta dig it up somehow 
Yeah yeah 


 


BIG BOOTS (AKA MAN O WAR)

 Drift all you like 
From ocean to ocean 
Search the whole world 
But drunken confessions 
And hijacked affairs will 
Just make you more alone 
 
If you come home 
I'll bake you a cake 
Made of all their eyes 
I wish you could see me 
Dressed for the kill 
What a nasty surprise 
You're my man o war 
 
And the worms will come for you 
Big Boots 
 
So unplug the phones 
Stop all the taps 
It all comes flooding back 
From poisoned cloud 
To poisoned dwarf 
What a nasty surprise 
You're my man o war 
 
And the worms will come for you 
Big boots 
Yeah the worms will come for you 
Big boots 
 


 


BIG IDEAS (AKA NUDE)

 Don't get any big ideas 
they're not gonna happen 
You paint your house white 
and feel the noise 
but they'll be something missing 
 
Just when you've found it, it's gone 
Just when you feel it, you don't 
?? 
 
Don't get any big ideas 
they're not going to happen 
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking 
 
Just when you've found it, its gone 
Just when you feel it, you don't 
?? 
 
 
Sometimes Thom adds this verse when performing: 
 
She stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed 
don't go, you'll only want to come back again 
 


 


BISHOP'S ROBES

 Dressed in bishop's robes 
Terrifies me still 
In bishop's robes 
Bastard headmaster 
I am not going back 
I am not going back 
I am not going back 
 
Children taught to kill, to tear themselves to bits 
On playing fields 
Dressed in bishop's robes 
I am not going back 
I am not going back 
I am not going back 


 


BLACK STAR

 i get home from work and 
you're still standing in your dressing 
gown 
well what am i to do? 
i know all the things around your head and what they do to 
you. 
what are we coming to? 
what are we gonna do? 
blame it on the black star 
blame it on the falling sky 
blame it on the satellite that beams me home. 
the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand 
what is eating you. 
i try to stay awake but its 58hrs since that i last slept with 
you. 
what are we coming to? 
i just don't know anymore. 
 
i get on the train and I just stand about now that i don't think 
of you. 
i keep falling over i keep passing out 
when i see a face like you. 
what am i coming to? 
im gonna melt down.

 


BLOW OUT

 In my mind [ ?? ] 
All the time killin' what I feel 
And everything I took 
 
All I took while she [ ?? ] 
All I took while she was crying 
 
Just a start... 
 
And everything I took 
 
All I took while she [ ?? ] 
All I took while she was crying 
 
I infuse just in case I blow out 
I am plain just in case I crack up 
 
Everything I took turns to stone 
 
All I took while she [ ?? ] 
All I took while she was crying

 


BONES

 I don't wanna a be krippled kracked 
shoulders wrists knees and back 
ground to dust and ash 
crawling on all fours. 
when you've got to feel it in your bones. 
Now i can't climb the stairs 
pieces missing everywhere 
prozak painkillersss. 
when you've got to feel it in your bones. 
and i used to fly like Peter Pan 
all the children flew when i touched their hands.

 


BULLET PROOF..I WISH I WAS

 limb by limb and tooth by tooth 
tearing up inside of me 
everyday everyhour wish that i 
was bullet proof. 
 
wax me 
mould me heat the pins 
and stab them in you have turned me into this 
just wish that it 
was bullet proof. 
 
so pay me money and take a shot 
lead fill 
the hole in me 
i could burst a million bubbles 
all 
surrogate & bullet proof.

 


CLIMBING UP THE WALLS

 I am the key to the lock in your house, 
that keeps your toys in the basement 
And if you get too far inside, 
you'll only see my reflection 
It's always best when the light is off, 
I am the pick in the ice 
Do not cry out or hit the alarm, 
we're friends till we die 
 
And either way you turn, 
I'll be there, open up your skull 
I'll be there, climbing up the walls 
 
It's always best when the light is off, 
it's always better on the outside 
Fifteen blows to the back of my head, 
fifteen blows to your mind 
So tuck the kids in safe tonight, 
shut the eyes in the cupboard 
So not cry out or hit the alarm, 
you'll get the loneliest feeling 
 
That either way you turn, 
I'll be there, open up your skull 
I'll be there, climbing up the walls 
 
Climb up the walls. climb up the walls

 


COKE BABIES

 Easy living 
Easy hold 
Easy teething 
Easy fold 
Easy listening 
Easy love 
Easy answers 
To easy questions 
 
Easy tumble 
Easy fall 
Easy rumble 
Easy doll 
I get up on 
Easy love 
I get up on 
Easy questions 


 


CREEP

 When you were here before 
Couldn't look you in the eye 
You're just like an angel 
Your skin makes me cry 
You float like a feather 
In a beautiful world 
And I wish I was special 
You're so fuckin' special 
 
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 
 
I don't care if it hurts 
I want to have control 
I want a perfect body 
I want a perfect soul 
I want you to notice 
When I'm not around 
You're so fuckin' special 
I wish I was special 
 
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 
 
She's running out again, 
She's running out 
She's run run run running out... 
 
Whatever makes you happy 
Whatever you want 
You're so fuckin' special 
I wish I was special... 
 
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 
I don't belong here.

 


CUTTOOTH

 I wanna be in the wallpaper 
Or run away to the foreign legion 
I wanna be in the wallpaper 
Or run away to the foreign legion 
 
And as the tanks roll into town 
As the tanks roll into town 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
 
As the tanks roll into town 
As the tanks roll into town 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
 
I dont know why I feel so tongue tied 
I dont know why I feel so skinned alive 
 
Hold you till the arms are sore 
Until you cannot feel it any more 
Hold you till the arms are sore 
Until you find an open door 
 
I built you up to pull you down 
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you 
I built you up to pull you down 
Tie you to the stake, and watch you crying out 
 
I dont know why I feel so tongue tied 
I dont know why I feel so skinned alive 
I'll find another skin to wear 
I'll find another skin to wear 


 


DOLLARS AND CENTS

 There are things to talk about 
Be constructive 
 
There are weapons, we can use 
Be constructive 
With your blues 
 
Even when they tore the wall down 
Even when they tore the wall down 
 
Why don't you quiet down? 
Why won't you quiet down? 
Why don't you quiet down? 
Why won't you quiet down? 
 
?? 
 
We are the dollar and cents

 


EL PRESIDENT

 It came from the skies 
It burst throught the gates 
With no mercy or disguise 
With their hearts set out in flames 
I know I've seen the master plan 
 
Well I'm just a man 
I'm not giving in 
All the people understand 
For they all fell down and prayed 
I know I've seen the master plan 
 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
 
It came from the skies 
In all shades of green 
We can always justify 
We can measure up your dreams 
I know I've seen the master plan 
 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
They've killed the president 
 
I'm just a man 


 


ELECTIONEERING

 I will stop, I will stop at nothing 
Say the right things, 
when electioneering I trust I can rely on your vote 
When I go forwards, you go backwards, 
somewhere we will meet 
When I go forwards, you go backwards, 
and somewhere we will meet 
 
Riot shields, voodoo economics, 
it's, it's just business 
Cattle prods and the IMF, 
I trust I can rely on your vote. 
When I go forwards, you go backwards, 
somewhere we will meet 
When I go forwards, you go backwards, 
somewhere we will meet

 


EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE

 Kid A, Kid A 
Kid A, Kid A 
Everything 
Everything 
Everything 
Everything in its right place 
In its right place 
In its right place 
In its right place 
 
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon 
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon 
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon 
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon 
 
Everything 
Everything 
Everything 
Everything in its right place 
In its right place 
In its right place 
Right place 
 
I've got two colours in my head 
I've got two colours in my head 
What was that you tried to say? 
What was that you tried to say? 
Tried to say 
Tried to say 
Tried to say 
Tried to say 
 
Everything in its right place... 


 


EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM)

 Wake from your sleep 
The drying of your tears, today we escape, we escape 
Pack and get dressed, 
before your father hears us, before, all hell breaks loose 
Breathe, keep breathing, 
don't lose your nerve, breathe, keep breathing 
I can't do this alone 
Sing us a song, a song to keep us warm, 
there's such a chill, such a chill 
 
You can laugh a spineless laugh 
We hope your rules and wisdom 
choke you now we are one in everlasting peace 
We hope that you choke, that you choke 
We hope that you choke, that you choke 
 
We hope that you choke, that you choke

 


FAITHLESS, THE WONDER BOY

 I've had these jeans since i was born 
And now they're ripped and now they're torn 
And all my friends have skateboards 
 
I want the toys of other boys 
I want a knife and a gun and things 
But mom and dad will not give in 
 
And i can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
I can't put the needle in 
No I can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
 
And now I know just what it is 
It's called disease and it's got my head 
It always runs where I hide 
 
Too scared too talk, too scared to try 
Too scared to know the reasons why 
And all my friends say bye bye 
 
And i can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
No I can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
 
And i can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
No I can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 
Can't put the needle in 


 


FAKE PLASTIC TREES

 HEr green plastiC wateringcan 
for her fake chineserubberplant 
in the fake plastic earth. 
that she bought from a rubber man 
in a town full of rubber PlanS 
to get rid of itself, it wears her out. 
 
SHe lives with a broken man, 
a cracked polystyreneman who just 
crumbles and burns. 
He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY always 
wins and it wears him out. 
 
She Looks like the real thing. 
She tastes like the real thing, 
my fake plastic love. 
 
But I Can't Help The Feeling. 
I Could Blow Through The Ceiling. 
If I Just Turn And RUN. 
and it wears me out. 
 
If i could be who you wanted all the time..

 


FAST TRACK

 (Instrumental)

 


FITTER HAPPIER

 Fitter, happier, 
more productive, 
comfortable, not drinking too much 
Regular exercise at the gym, 3 days a week 
Getting on better 
with your associate employee contemporaries at ease 
Eating well, 
no more microwave dinners and saturated fats 
A patient better driver, a safer car, 
baby smiling in back seat 
Sleeping well, no bad dreams, no paranoia 
Careful to all animals, 
never washing spiders down the plughole 
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then 
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall 
Favors for favors, fond but not in love 
Charity standing orders 
on sundays ring road supermarket 
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants 
Car wash, also on sundays, 
no longer afraid 
of the dark or midday shadows 
Nothing so ridiculously teenage 
and desperate nothing so childish 
At a better pace, 
slower and more calculated, no chance of escape 
Now self employed, concerned, but powerless 
An empowered and informed member of society, 
pragmatism not idealism 
Will not cry in public, 
less chance of illness, 
tires that grip in the wet 
Shot of baby strapped in back seat, 
a good memory still cries at a good film 
Still kisses with saliva, 
no longer empty and frantic like a cat tied to a stick 
That's driven into frozen winter shit, 
the ability to laugh at weakness 
Calm fitter, healthier 
and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics

 


FOG

 There's a little child 
Running round this house 
And he never leaves 
He will never leave 
And the fog comes up from the sewers 
And glows in the dark 
 
Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast 
Grow up fast 
Anything you want it can be done 
How did you go bad? 
Did you go bad? 
Did you go bad? 
Somethings will never wash away 
Did you go bad? 
Did you go bad?

 


FOLLOW ME AROUND

 I see you in the dark 
falling down the fast lane 
calling out to me 
oh that's where i'll be 
crawling out to me 
crawling out to me 
 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
 
even when your coming down 
and i'll take you for a walk 
then i can see you 
I'm feeling it coming down 
 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
you follow me around 
I feel it 
I feel it 
 


 


GAGGING ORDER

 I know what you're thinking 
But I'm not your property 
No matter what you say 
No matter what you say 
 
Move along, there's nothing left to see 
Just a body, nothing left to see 
 
A couple more for breakfast 
A little more for tea 
Just to take the edge off 
Just to take the edge off 
 
Move along, there's nothing left to see 
Just a body, pouring down the street 
 
Move along, there's nothing left to see 
Just a body, nothing left to see 
 
Move along

 


GO TO SLEEP

 Something for the rag and bone man 
 Over my dead body 
Something big is gonna happen 
 Over my dead body 
 
Someone's son or someone's daughter 
 Over my dead body 
This is how I end up getting sucked in 
 Over my dead body 
 
I'm gonna go to sleep 
Let this wash all over me 
 
We don't wanna wake monster taking over 
 Tiptoe round tie him down 
We don't want the loonies taking over 
 Tiptoe round tie them down 
 
May pretty horses 
Come to you 
As you sleep 
I'm gonna go to sleep 
Let this wash 
All over me 
 


 


HIGH & DRY

 two jumps in a week i bet you think 
that's pretty clever don't you 
boy. 
flying on your 
motorcycle. 
watching all the ground beneath you 
drop. 
you'd kill yourself for recognition. 
kill yourself to 
never 
ever 
stop. 
you broke another mirror.you're turning 
into something you are not. 
 
drying up in conversation 
you will be the one who cannot talk. 
all your insides fall to pieces. 
you just sit there 
wishing 
you 
could 
still 
make 
love. 
they're the ones who'll hate you 
when you think you've got the world 
all sussed out. 
they're the ones who'll spit at you. 
you will be the one 
screaming 
out. 
 
it's the best thing that you ever had.

 


HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

 Seen all good things and bad Running down the hill All so Battered and Brought to the ground I am hungry again I am drunk again With all the money I owe to my friends When i'm like this how can you be smiling Saying How can you be sure? How can you be sure? If you walk out the door Will I see you again? If so much of me lies in your eyes I am hungry again I am drunk again With all the money I owe to my friends When I'm like this how can you be smiling saying how can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore) How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore) How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore) How can you be sure? I don't want you I don't want you anymore I don't want you I don't want you anymore 


HOW DO YOU?

 His banner is twistin' He knows what he wants He wants to be looked at He wants to be loved He wants us to listen He wants us to leave And he was a stupid baby Turned into a powerful freak How do you? How do you? How do you? He's just like his mother But we showed him respect He's a dangerous bigot But we always forget And he's just like his daddy Cuz he cheats on his friends And he steals anybody's Any way that he can How do you? How do you? How do you? 


HOW I MADE MILLIONS

 i was stronger 
i was better 
picked you out 
 
now don't say a word 
no don't yell out 
never mind 
 
let you out 
led you back 
stay on 
sit down 
 
let it fall 
let it fall 
let it fall 
let it fall 


 


HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY

 That there 
That's not me 
I go 
Where I please 
I walk through walls 
I float down the Liffey 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 
 
In a little while 
I'll be gone 
The moment's already passed 
Yeah it's gone 
And I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 
 
Strobe lights and blown speakers 
Fireworks and hurricanes 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here

 


HUNTING BEARS

 (Instrumental)

 


I AM A WICKED CHILD

 Mother mary come to me 
Cause I am a wicked child 
I have sinned and I am so confused and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
 
I am the devils son and I wish I could be good for you 
I walk a crooked mile 
but I wish I could be good 
I wish I could be good 
 
If I could have kept the straight and narrow 
If I could have kept the straight and narrow 
And not have broke your heart 
Not have broke your heart 
 
Now I wake up in the night 
Lying on my bed 
It's tugging at my arms and legs 
Like I was a marionette 
 
Send baby Jesus 
Surely it is time 
Send baby jesus 
Let him radiate his light 
Radiate his light 
 
lyrics from 24 03 2000 webcast: 
I am the devils son and I wish I could be good for you 
and make you satisfied if I could keep on the straight and narrow and not have broke your heartwicked child 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
because I am a wicked child 
and I deserve to go to hell 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
and I am a wicked child & I am a wicked child 
and I am a wicked child 
I am a..

 


I AM CITIZEN INSANE

 (Instrumental)

 


I CAN'T

 Please forget the words 
that I just blurted out 
It wasn't me, 
it was a strange and creepy doubt 
 
They keep drivin' in my cage 
There's nothing in this world to keep the time 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
I can't 
 
See the things that keep, keep me uninvolved 
Silly words that I, that I can't live without 
 
If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
I can't 
 
If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
 
I can't

 


I MIGHT BE WRONG

 I might be wrong 
I might be wrong 
I could have sworn 
I saw a light coming on 
 
I used to think 
I used to think 
There is no future left at all 
I used to think 
 
Open up, begin again 
Let's go down the waterfall 
Think about the good times 
And never look back 
Never look back 
 
What would I do? 
What would I do? 
If I did not have you? 
 
Open up, let me in 
Let's go down the waterfall 
Have ourselves a good time 
It's nothing at all 
Nothing at all 
Nothing at all

 Being the first in the Irish Sea 
I got a message I can't read 
Another message I can't read 
 
Being the first in the Irish Sea 
I got a message I can't read 
Another message I can't read 
 
I'm on your side 
Nowhere to hide 
Trapdoors that open 
I spiral down 
 
You're living in a fantasy 
You're living in a fantasy 
 
I'm lost at sea 
Don't bother me 
I've lost my way 
I've lost my way 
 
You're living in a fantasy 
You're living in a fantasy 
You're living in a fantasy 
This beautiful world 
 
Being the first in the Irish Sea 
I got a message I can't read 
Another message I can't read 


 


INDIA RUBBER

 Did it all for you to say 
You never wanted me that way 
Now the dogs have had their meat 
I think i will go plug in the mains 
 
I tumble like a cloud 
Before you burn in hell 
I suffocate myself into your hair 
 
Will the sparrow make her smile 
I'm instantly your biggest fan 
How was i to know 
that you practised it before hand? 
 
I tumble like a cloud 
Before you burn in hell 
I suffocate myself into your hair 


 


INNOCENTS CIVILIAN

 

 


INSIDE MY HEAD

 What do you want from me? 
Now you got me 
Now my fingers bleed 
Now they're staring at me 
I'm a coward now 
I hold my peace 
 
Now you tie me up to your feather bed 
And I twist and turn in a chinese burn 
You won't let go 
You won't let go 
 
You're inside my head 
Inside my head 
 
What do you want from me? 
Now you got me 
Now my energy you suck from me 
And I'm holding on for dear life 
 
Quit smothering me 
Quit laughing at me 
I've got a disease 
An English disease 
It won't let go 
It won't let go 
 
You're inside my head 
Inside my head 
 
What did you put in that syringe? 
Whatever you really said to him? 
Is sitting there, inside of me 
 
And you bother me 
You posess me 
You're there again 
Ahead of me 
And I won't let go 
I won't let go 
 
You're inside my head 
Inside my head 
Inside my head 
Inside my head 


 


JUST

 can't get the stink off, 
he's been hanging around for days. 
comes like a comet, 
suckered you but not your friends. 
one day he'll get to you, 
teach you how to be a holy cow. 
 
don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor. 
you've changed the locks 3 times, 
he still comes reeling through the door. 
and soon he'll get to you, 
teach you how to get to purest hell. 
 
you do it to yourself you do 
and that's what really hurts is 
you do it to yourself just you, 
you and no one else 
you do it to yourself.

 


KARMA POLICE

 Karma Police, arrest this man, he talks in maths 
He buzzes like a fridge, he's like a detuned radio 
Karma Police, arrest this girl, her hitler hairdo, 
is making me feel ill 
And we have crashed her party 
This is what you get, this is what you get 
This is what you get, when you mess with us 
 
Karma Police, I've given all I can, it's not enough 
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll 
This is what you get, this is what you get 
This is what you get, when you mess with us 
And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself 
And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself 
 
For a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

 


KID A

 I slipped away 
I slipped on a little white lie 
We've got heads on sticks 
You've got ventriloquists 
We've got heads on sticks 
You've got ventriloquists 
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed 
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed 
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed 
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed 
Rats and children follow me out of town 
Rats and children follow me out of their homes 
Watch it 


 


KILLER CARS

 To hard on the brakes again, 
What if these brakes just give in? 
What if they don't get outta the way? 
What if there's someone overtaking? 
 
I'm going out on a little drive, 
and it could be the last time I see you alive 
There could be an idiot on the road, 
The only kick in life is pumping that steel. 
Lock me up in the back of the trunk, 
packed with foam and blind drunk. 
 
They won't ever catch me alive, cause they all drive.. 
 
Don't die on the motorway, 
The moon would freeze, the plants would die, 
I couldn't cope if you crashed today, 
All the things I forgot to say, 
 
I'm going out on the little drive, 
and it could be the last time I see you alive, 
There could be an idiot on the road, 
the only kick in life if pumping that steel, 
Lock me up in the back of the trunk, 
packed with foam and blind drunk. 
 
They won't ever catch me alive, cause they all drive... 
Killer Cars.. yeah.. 
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey.. hey.. 
 
Wrap me up in the back of a trunk, 
packed with foam and blind drunk. 
They won't ever catch me alive, cause they all drive... 
Killer Cars... 
They all drive... Killer Cars 
They all driiiive....... Killer Cars 


 


KINETIC

 You're being took for a ride 
Plain, old and lazy

I'll wait for you but you never came 
Please keep moving 
Better keep moving 
 
Please keep moving 
Better keep moving

KNIVES OUT

 I want you to know 
He's not coming back 
Look into my eyes 
I'm not coming back 
 
So knives out 
Catch the mouse 
Don't look down 
Shove it in your mouth 
 
If you'd been a dog 
They would've drowned you at birth 
 
Look into my eyes 
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth 
 
So knives out 
Cook him up 
Squash his head 
Put him in the pot 
 
I want you to know 
He's not coming back 
He's bloated and frozen 
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste 
 
So knives out 
Catch the mouse 
Squash his head 
Put him in the pot 


 


LAST FLOWERS TILL THE HOSPITAL

 

 


LET DOWN

 Transport, motorways and tram lines 
Starting and then stopping, taking off and landing 
The emptiest of feelings disappointed people 
clinging onto bottles and 
When it comes its so so disappointing 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around 
 
Shell smashed, juices flowing wings twitch, 
legs are going 
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel 
One day I'm going to grow wings 
A chemical reaction, 
hysterical and useless hysterical and 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around let down again 
 
You know, you know where you are with you, 
know where you are 
With floor collapses floating, 
bouncing back and one day 
I am gonna grow wings 
A chemical reaction, 
hysterical and useless hysterical and 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around

 


LEWIS (MISTREATED)

 Bummed out again 
Buy early business friend 
The smell of fear is bigger than you think 
 
Hey don't do it 
Do it 
 
Change seem to fit 
In the end you just feel sick 
And then you choke on an anesthetic 
 
Hey don't do it 
Lewis 
Lewis 
Save yourself the pain 
You'll never get there 
Lewis 
Save yourself the pain 
It never really matters here 
 
We never noticed 
We never understood 
He just get crushed to fit 
He never even smile 
 
At the best, it's the best, 
It's the best day I know 
 
Lewis 
Save yourself the pain 
You'll never get there 
Lewis 
Save yourself the pain 
It never really matters here 
 
Lewis 
Mistreated 
I call you blue 
Lewis 
Mistreated 
I call you blue 
 
I don't wanna talk about it 
I don't wanna talk about it 
I don't wanna talk about Lewis! Lewis! Lewis! 
I don't wanna talk about it 
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis! 


 


LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE

 Once again, she is smashing up her house again 
She is throwing things through windows 
She is mad at someone else again, 
It is now a broken home 
 
Once again, I am so low with my only friend 
He is smashing up his house again 
You are throwing things at me again 
And I'm wrecked up all inside 
 
Well if I stop that singing now and shout 
Well if I stop that singing to you friend 
Well if I stop that singing now and shout 
Someone is standing there 
 
There I'm home, once the feet inside shout it out 
Once a beating when I make my way out 
Once a beating when I'm home inside 
There is nothing wrong at all 
 
Well if I stop that singing now and shout 
Well if I stop that singing to you friend 
Well if I stop that singing now and shout 
Someone is standing there

 


LIFT

 this is the place. 
sit down, your safe now. 
you've been stuck in a lift. 
we've been trying to reach you, thom. 
this is the place. 
it won't hurt, it will not hurt 
a scent of recognition. 
a face you never loved. 
empty all your pockets. 
cause it's time to go home. 
this is the place. 
remembering all the things you always see 
you've been stuck in a lift. 
in the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean 
a scent of recognition. 
a face you never loved. 
empty all your pockets. 
it's time to come home. 
today is the first day 
of the rest of your days. 
so lighten up, squirt.

 


LIKE SPINNING PLATES

 Why do we play these foolish games? 
Only consolations 
You feed me to the lions 
I didn't need at all 
 
And this just feels like spinning plates 
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land 
And this just feels like spinning plates 
My body is floating down the muddy river

 


LOZENGE OF LOVE

 I am gone 
Everybody's waiting 
And these fruit 
Just a twist of poison 
I won't be alone 
When you're running in me 
I can't stay 
Like i'm somewhere always 
I need more 
A restless body cracks and rolls 
I won't have the strength 
When you're running in me 


 


LUCKY

 I'm on a roll, 
I'm on a roll, 
this time, 
I feel my luck could change 
Kill me Sarah, 
kill me again with love, 
it's gonna be a glorious day 
Pull me out of the aircrash, 
pull me out of the wreck, 
cause I'm your superhero 
We are standing on the edge 
The head of state is calling my name but I, 
I don't have time for you 
It's gonna be a glorius day, 
I feel my luck could change 
Pull me out of the aircrash, 
pull me out of the wreck, 
cause I'm your superhero 
We are standing on the edge, 
we are standing on the edge 
 
We are standing on the edge

 


LULL

 you stopped the crowd 
i cried out to break the spell 
you waved and smiled 
i just snapped and lost control 
distracted by irrelevance 
the stress and the tension 
(the stress and the tension) 
i'm in a lull 
there's nothing more dull than talking 
talking 'bout yourself 
but what i meant to say 
i'm sorry that i lost control 
distraeted by irrelevance 
the stress and the tension 
crawling through the keyhole 
well i'm in a lull 


 


LURGEE

 I feel better, 
I feel better now you've gone 
 
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong 
 
I feel better, 
I feel better, now there's nothing wrong 
 
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong 
 
Tell me something, 
Tell me something I don't know 
 
Tell me one thing, 
Tell me one thing, let it go 
 
I got something, 
I got something heaven knows 
 
I got something, 
I got something I don't know

 


MAN O WAR

 drift all you like from ocean to ocean 
search the whole worid drunken confessione 
and hijacks and films just make you moan alone 
if you come home i'll make you a cake 
lay your velvet eyes 
i wish i couid see you just when i kill 
you're my man o war 
and the worms will eat you whole 
so unplug your phone 
stop all the chatter 
it all comes flooding back 
from poisoned clouds 
to poison the world 
you're my man o war 
and the worms will eat you whole, my love 
and the worms will eat your home 
you whole my love 


 


MAQUILADORA

 Here it comes, Here it comes, 
I can feel the hills exploding 
Exploding gracefully 
Burning up the freeway 
Here it comes 
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble 
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble 
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you. 
Oh baby burn 
 
Fast die younger 
Burns rubber 
Useless rockers 
From England 
Good times 
Had by all 
Just swallow your guilt and your crutches 
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal 
Interstate fire walk staright down the middle, 
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you 
Oh baby burn

 


MEETING IN THE AISLE

 (Instrumental)

 


MELATONIN

 Don't forget, that you are our son. 
Now go back to bed. 
 
We just know that you'll do well 
You won't come to harm. 
 
Death to all who stand in your way, 
Wake my dear.

 


METTING IN THE AISLE

 (Instrumental)

 


MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION

 Was always waiting for the crush 
The car to drive right through the shops 
To call in sick and late at work 
And take a holiday 
 
Was always tangled up in knots 
To keep myself from speaking up 
But no one's listening anyway 
Just trying to bribe me 
 
And if it's alright 
Then what are we doing here? 
And if it's alright 
This place is gassed by fear 
And if it's alright 
I'll tell you cos you never understand 
And if it's alright I'll beg you 
'Cause I'm a begging kind of man 
 
Today I wrote a bad cheque 
Packed a bag and took a jet 
And no one's looking anyway 
I hope you miss me 
 
(Sometimes I think maybe I'm making a big mistake) 


 


MOLASSES

 Shake hands 
Genocide 
Molasses 
Jet powered caravans 
Molasses 
I'm too good 
You're stuck on 
Rent free earthquake zone 
Molasses 
 
I need someone else's glasses. 
Starving waitresses in plasters, 
Fat houseflies 
Genocide 
We've been stitched up 
Molasses 


 


MORNING BELL

 The morning bell 
The morning bell 
Had a null encounter 
Release me 
Release me 
 
You can keep the furniture 
A bump on the head 
Howling down the chimney 
Release me 
Release me 
Please 
Release me 
Release me 
 
Where'd you park the car 
Where'd you park the car 
Clothes are all alone with the furniture 
Now I might as well 
I might as well 
 
Sleepy jack the fire drill 
Running around around around... 
 
Cut the kids in half 
Cut the kids in half 
Cut the kids in half 
 
I wanted to tell you but you never listened 
You never understand 
I wanted to tell you but you never listened 
You never understand 
Cos I'm walking walking walking... 
 
The lights are on but nobody's home 
Everybody wants to be a 
The lights are on but nobody's home 
Everybody wants to be a singer 
Walking walking walking... 
 
The lights are on but nobody's at home 
Everybody wants to be a 
Everyone wants to be a friend 
Nobody wants to be a singer 
Walking walking walking... 


 


MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK

 Red wine and sleeping pills 
Help me get back to your arms 
Cheap sex and sad films 
Help me get back where I belong 
 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
 
Stop sending letters 
Letters always get burned 
It's not like the movies 
They fed us on little white lies 
 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
 
I will see you in the next life

MYXOMATOSIS

 the mongrel cat came home 
holding half a head 
Proceeded to show it off 
to all his new found friends 
he said i been where i liked 
i slept with who i liked 
she ate me up for breakfast 
and screwed me in a vice 
 
and now i don't know why 
i feel so tongue tied 
 
i sat in the cupboard 
and wrote it down in neat 
they were cheering and waving 
cheering and waving 
twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis 
but it got edited fucked up 
strangled, beaten up 
used as a photo in Time magazine 
buried in a burning black hole in Devon 
 
 i don t know why 
i feel so tongue tied 
 
don t know why 
i feel so skinned alive. 
 
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive 
I twitch and i salivate like with myxomatosis 
you should put me in a home or you should put me down 
I got myxomatosis 
I got myxomatosis 
 
 now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars 
that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason 
it must have got mixed up 
strangled, beaten up 
i got myxomatosis 
i got myxomatosis 
 
 i don t know why 
i feel so tongue tied 
 


 


NICE DREAM

 they love me like i was a brother 
they protect me 
listen to me 
they dug me my very own garden 
gave me sunshine 
made me happy. nice dream. 
 
i call up my friend the good angel 
but she's out with 
her ansaphone 
she says she would love to come help but 
the sea would 
electrocute us all. nice dream. 
 
if you think that you're strong enough 
if you think you belong enough. 
 
nice dream.

 


NO RIPCORD

 Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys 
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed 
You feel it till you're dry 
You feel it till you've had enough 
And you don't understand 
 
No Ripcord, no ripcord 
No Ripcord, no ripcord 
 
Airplane, do I mean what I mean 
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh airplane 
 
A thousand miles an hour 
The politics of power 
See you don't understand 
 
No Ripcord, no ripcord 
No Ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers 
[ ?? ] 
 
No Ripcord, no ripcord

NO SURPRISES

 A heart that's full up like a landfill, 
a job that slowly kills you, 
bruises that won't heal 
You were so tired, happy,

I'll take the quiet life, 
a handshake of carbon monoxide

 nothing touches me man

when i turn away she's split 
i try to make her listen 
when i turn away she's split 
she went... 
nothing touches me 
nothing touches me now 
nothing touches me man 
no matter how you split

OPTIMISTIC

 Flies are buzzing round my head 
Vultures circling the dead 
Picking up every last crumb 
The big fish eat the little ones 
The big fish eat the little ones 
Not my problem, give me some 
You can try the best you can 
If you try the best you can 
The best you can is good enough 
If you try the best you can 
If you try the best you can 
The best you can is good enough 
This one's optimistic 
This one went to market 
This one just came out of the swamp 
This one dropped a payload 
Fodder for the animals 
Living on animal farm 
If you try the best you can 
If you try the best you can 
The best you can is good enough 
If you try the best you can 
If you try the best you can 
The best you can is good enough 
I'd really like to help you, man 
I'd really like to help you, man 
And now this messed up millionaire 
Floating around on a prison ship 
If you try the best you can 
If you try the best you can 
The best you can is good enough 
If you can try the best you can 
If you try the best you can

PACKT LIKE SARDINES IN A CRUSHED TIN BOX

 After years of waiting nothing came 
As your life flashed before your eyes 
You realize 
 
I'm a reasonable man 
Get off, get off, get off my case (x2) 
I'm a reasonable man 
Get off my case 
Get off my case 
 
After years of waiting 
After years of waiting nothing came 
And you realize you're looking,

PALO ALTO

 In a city of the future, 
it is hard to consentrate. 
Meet the boss, meet the wife, 
everybody's happy, 
everyone is made for life. 
 
In a city of the future, 
it is difficult to find a space. 
I'm to busy to see you, 
you're to busy to wait. 
 
Well I'm ok, how are you? 
Thanks for asking 
Thanks for asking. 
Well I'm ok, how are you? 
We hope that you are ok too. 
 
Everyone of those days, 
when the sky is californian blue. 
A beautiful bombshell, 
I throw myself into my world 
Two day, I've been waiting for so long. 
 
Well I'm ok, how are you? 
Thanks for asking 
Thanks for asking. 
Well I'm ok, how are you? 
We hope that you are ok too

PARANOID ANDROID

 Please could you stop the noise 
I'm trying to get some rest? 
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head 
What's that, what's that 
 
When I am king you will be first against the wall 
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all 
What's that, what's that 
 
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly 
Kicking squealing gucci little piggy 
 
You don't remember, you don't remember, 
why don't you remember my name 
Off with his head man, off with his head man 
Why don't you remember my name? 
I guess he does 
 
Rain down, rain down, come on rain down on me 
From a great height, from a great height, height 
Rain down, rain down, come on rain down on me 
From a great height, from a great height, height 
 
(repeats 3rd time, underneath vocals are:) 
That's it sir, you're leaving, 
the crackle of pig skin, 
the dust and the screaming 
The yuppies networking 
the panic, the vomit, 
the panic, the vomit 
God loves his children, 
God loves his children, yeah

It's just i can't believe that we returned 
Let's get out

PLANET TELEX

 you can force it but it will not come. 
you can taste it but it will not form. 
you can crush it but it's always here. 
you can crush it but it's always near 
chasing you home 
saying everything is broken 
everyone is broken. 
 
you can force it but it will stay stung. 
you can crush it as dry as a bone. 
you can walk it straight home from school. 
you can kiss it you can break all the rules 
but still everything is broken, 
everyone is broken. 
why can't you forget? 
 


 


POLYETHYLENE (PARTS 1 & 2)

 go. 
Disjointed we scare ourselves with all that we wanna be. 
Just got paid and now you're going, how long should you be? 
If I get scared, I just call you. 
And I, miss your glow as I unsettle, 
Oh I'll always feel, I'll always be.

POP IS DEAD

 Oh no, pop is dead 
Long live pop. 
It died an ugly death, 
By back catalogue. 
 
And know you know it gets you nowhere, 
And now you know you realise. 
 
Oh no, pop is dead 
It just gave up, 
We raise the dead but they won't stand up. 
 
And radio have salmonella, 
And now you know you gotta die. 
It left this message for us. 
 
So what, pop is dead, it's no great loss 
So many face lifts, it's face flew off. 
 
The Emperor he has no clothes on, 
And his skin is pealing off. 
 
Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop, 
One final lot of coke to jerk him off... 
Jack him off.. He left this message for us. 
 
He left this message for us. 
He left this message for us. 


 


PROVE YOURSELF

 I can't afford to breathe 
in this town 
Nowhere to sit 
with out a gun in my hand 
Look back up to the cathode ray... 
 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off... 
 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
 
I want to breathe, I want to grow 
I say I want it but I don't know how 
I look, I bleed, I beg and pray 
 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off... 
 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off... 
 
Prove yourself...

 


PULL / PULK REVOLVING DOORS

 There are barn doors And there are revolving doors Doors on the rudders of big ships We are revolving doors There are doors that open by themselves There are sliding doors And there are secret doors There are doors that lock And doors that don't There are doors that let you in And out But never open But they are trapdoors That you can't come back from 


PUNCHDRUNK LOVESICK SINGALONG

 I wrapped you inside my coat 
When they came to fire upon the house 
I didn't feel pain 
Cause no one can touch me 
Now that i'm held in your smile 
 
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into doubt 
Sell me a car that goes 
Sell me a house that stands 
Oh 
I never cared before 
I never cared before 
I never cared before 
Before 
Before 
Before 
 
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into doubt 
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn you world into doubt 
Yeah 
I stood in front of her face 
When the first bullet 
Was shot 


 


PYRAMID SONG

 I jumped in the river and what did I see? 
Black eyed angels swam with me 
A moon full of stars and astral cars 
All the things I used to see 
All my lovers were there with me 
All my past and futures 
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt 
 
I jumped into the river 
Black eyed angels swam with me 
A moon full of stars and astral cars 
And all the things I used to see 
All my lovers were there with me 
All my past and futures 
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt 
 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

 


RABBIT IN YOUR HEADLIGHTS

 I'm a rabbit in your headlights 
Scared of the spotlight 
You don't come to visit 
I'm stuck on this bed 
 
Thin rubber gloves 
She laughs when she's crying 
She cries when she's laughing 
 
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away 
 
I'm a rabbit in your headlights 
Christian suburbanite 
Washed down the toilet 
Money to burn 
 
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away 
 
If you're frightened of dying and then you hold on 
You'll see devils tearing your life away 
But, if you've made your peace 
Then the devils are really angels 
Freeing you from the Earth... from the Earth 
 
White worms on the underground 
Caught between stations 
Butter fingers 
I'm losing my patience 
 
I'm a rabbit in your headlights 
Christian suburbanite 
You got money to burn 
 
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away... away... away..

REMYXOMATOSIS

 The mongrel cat came home 
holding half a head 
Proceeded to show it off 
to all his new found friends 
he said i been where i liked 
i slept with who i liked 
she ate me up for breakfast 
and screwed me in a vice 
 
and now i don't know why 
i feel so tongue tied 
 
i sat in the cupboard 
and wrote it down in neat 
they were cheering and waving 
cheering and waving 
twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis 
but it got edited fucked up 
strangled, beaten up 
used as a photo in Time magazine 
buried in a burning black hole in Devon 
 
 i don t know why 
i feel so tongue tied 
 
don t know why 
i feel so skinned alive. 
 
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive 
I twitch and i salivate like with myxomatosis 
you should put me in a home or you should put me down 
I got myxomatosis 
I got myxomatosis 
 
 now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars 
that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason 
it must have got mixed up 
strangled, beaten up 
i got myxomatosis 
i got myxomatosis 
 
 i don t know why 
i feel so tongue tied 

 


SAIL TO THE MOON

 I sucked the moon 
I spoke too soon 
And how much did it cost? 
I was dropped from moonbeams 
And sailed on shooting stars 
 
Maybe you'll 
Be president 
But know right from wrong 
Or in the flood 
You'll build an Ark 
And sail us to the moon 
Sail us to the moon 
Sail to the moon 
 


 


SCATTERBRAIN

 I'm walking out in a force ten gale. 
birds thrown around, bullets for hail. 
the roof is pulling off by its fingernails. 
your voice is rapping on my window sill 
 
yesterday's headlines blown by the wind. 
yesterday's people end up scatterbrain. 
then any fool can easy pick a hole. (I only wish I could fall in) 
a moving target in a firing range. 
 
somewhere I'm not 
scatterbrain. 
somewhere I'm not 
scatterbrain. 
lightning fuse 
powercut. 
scatterbrain 
 


 


SIT DOWN, STAND UP

 Sit down, stand up 
Sit down, stand up 
 
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up) 
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up) 
Anytime (sit down) 
Anytime (stand up) 
 
Sit down, stand up 
Sit down, stand up 
 
We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up) 
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up) 
Anytime 
Anytime 
 
Stand up, sit down 
 
The rain drops (repeated) 
 


 


STOP WHISPERING

 And the wise man said 
 I don't wanna hear your voice 
And the thin man said 
 I don't wanna hear your voice 
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
 
And my mother said 
 Let me spit on you son some more 
And the [? building ?] said 
 Let me spit on your face some more 
 
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong 
Cuz I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 
 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
 
They said, I have a complaint 
 Can't remember what it is 
 That's why I'm here 
 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting

 


STREET SPIRIT (FADE OUT)

 rows of houses all bearing down on me 
i can feel their blue hands touching me 
all these things in all positions 
all these things will one day take control 
and fade out again and fade out 
 
this machine will will not communicate these thoughts 
and the strain i am under 
be a world child form a circle before we all go under 
and fade out again and fade out again 
 
cracked eggs dead birds 
scream as they fight for life 
i can feel death can see it's beady eyes 
all these things into frution 
all these things we'll one day swallow whole 
and fade out again and fade out again.

 


STUPID CAR

 I find it hard 
To drive your stupid car 
I find it hard 
Cause I never get that far 
And you put my brain in overload 
And I can't change gears 
I cannot see the road 
You got concrete eyes 
And I cannot see your face 
And I failed in life 
Cause you crushed me with your hands 
And you put my brain in overload 
I can't change gears 
I cannot see the road

 


SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK ALIEN

 The breath of the morning 
I keep forgetting the smell of the warm summer air 
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing 
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement 
Up above aliens hover making home movies 
for the folks back home 
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits 
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets 
 
They're all uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight 
 
I wish that they'd swoop down 
in the country lane late at night when I'm driving 
Take me onboard their beautiful ship 
show me the weird world as I'd love to see it 
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me 
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely 
I'd show them the stars 
and the meaning of life they'd shut me away 
But I'll be all right, all right 
I'm all right, all right 
 
I'm just uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight

 


SULK

 you bite through the big wall 
the big wall bites back 
you sit there and sulk 
sit there and bawl 
you are so pretty 
when you're on your knees 
disinfected 
eager to please 
 
sometimes you sulk 
sometimes you burn 
god rest your soul 
when the loving comes 
and we've already gone 
just like your dad 
you'll never change 
 
each time it comes 
it eats me alive 
i try to behave 
but it eats me alive 
so i declare a holiday 
fall asleep 
drift away.

 


TALK SHOW HOST

 I want to 
I want to be someone else or I'll explode 
Floating upon this surface for the birds 
The birds 
The birds 
 
You want me? 
Fucking well come and find me 
I'll be waiting 
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches 
And nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing 
 
You want me? 
Well come and break the door down 
You want me? 
Fucking come and break the door down 
I'm ready 
I'm ready 
I'm ready 
I'm ready 
I'm ready 


 


THE AMAZING SOUNDS OF ORGY

 I want to see you smile again 
Like diamonds in the dust 
The amazing sound of the killing hordes 
The day the banks collapse on us 
 
Cease this endless chattering 
Like everything is fine 
When sorry is not good enough 
Sit in the back while no one drives 
 
So glad you're mine 


 


THE BENDS

 where do we go from here? 
the words are coming out all wierd 
where are you now when i need you? 
alone on an aeroplane 
falling asleep against the window pane 
my blood will THICKEN. 
 
i need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain 
i'd be scared that there's nothing underneath 
and who are my real friends? 
have they all got the bends? 
am i really sinking this low? 
 
my baby's got the bends 
we don't have any real friends 
i'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on 
talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen 
and i wish it was the sixties 
i wish i could be happy 
i wish 
i wish 
i wish that something would happen.. 
 
where do we go from here? 
the words are coming out all wierd 
where are you now when i need you? 
they brought in the CIA 
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away 
to blow me sky high. 
 
my baby's got the bends 
we don't have any real friends 
i'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on 
talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen 
and i wish it was the sixties 
i wish i could be happy 
i wish 
i wish 
i wish that something would happen 
 
i want to live and breathe 
i want to be part of the human race 
 
where do we go from here? 
the words are coming out all wierd 
where are you now when i need you?

 


THE CHAINS

 

 


THE GLOAMING

 Genie let out the bottle 
It is now the witching hour 
Genie let out the bottle 
It is now the witching hour 
 
Murderers you're murderers 
We are not the same as you 
 
Genie let out the bottle 
Funny haha funny how 
 
When the walls bend 
When the walls bend 
With your breathing 
With your breathing 
 
When the walls bend 
When the walls bend 
With your breathing 
With your breathing 
With your breathing 
 
They will suck you down 
To the otherside 
They will suck you down 
To the otherside 
They will suck you down 
To the otherside 
They will suck you down 
To the otherside 
 
To the shadows blue and red 
To the shadows blue and red 
Your alarm bells

To the shadows blue and red 
To the shadows blue and red 
Your alarm bells 
Your alarm bells 
 
Should be ringing 
 
This is the gloaming 
 


 


THE NATIONAL ANTHEM

 Everyone 
Everyone around here 
Everyone is so near 
What's going on? 
What's going on? 
 
Everyone 
Everyone is so near 
Everyone has got the fear 
What's going on? 
What's going on? 
 
What's going on? 
What's going on? 
What's going on? 


 


THE TOURIST

 It barks at no one else but me 
like it's seen a ghost 
I guess it seen the sparks, 
a flowing no one else would know 
Hey man slow down, slow down, 
idiot slow down, slow down 
 
Sometimes I get overcharged 
that's when you see sparks 
You ask me where the hell I'm going 
at thousand feet per second? 
Hey man, slow down, slow down, 
idiot slow down, slow down 
 
Hey man, slow down, slow down, 
idiot slow down, slow down.

 


THE TRICKSTER

 Rust in the mountains 
Rust in the brain 
The air is sacred here 
In spite of your claim 
Up on the roof tops 
Out of reach 
Trickster is meaningless 
Trickster is weak 
He's talking out the world 
Talking out the world Hey 
Hey 
Hey 
This is only halfway 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey 
This is only halfway 
 
I wanted you so bad 
And I couldn't say 
All things fall apart 
We wanted out so bad 
We couldn't say 
These things fall apart 
We're talking out the world 
Talking out the world 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey 
This is only halfway 
Hey 
Hey 
Hey 
This is only halfway 
 
Truant kids a can of brick dust worms 
Who do not want to climb down from 
Their chestnut tree 
Long white gloves 
Police tread carefully 
Escaped from the zoo 
The perfect child facsimile 
It's Talking out the world 
Talking out the world 


 


THERE THERE

 in pitch dark i go walking in your landscape. 
broken branches trip me as i speak. 
just because you feel it doesnt mean it's there. 
just because you feel it doesnt mean it's there. 
 
there's always a siren 
singing you to shipwreck. 
(don't reach out, don't reach out) 
steer away from these rocks 
we'd be a walking disaster. 
(don't reach out, don't reach out) 
 
just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there. 
(there's someone on your shoulder) 
just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there. 
(there's someone on your shoulder) 
 
there there 
 
why so green and lonely? 
heaven sent you to me. 
 
we are accidents 
waiting waiting to happen. 
 
we are accidents 
waiting waiting to happen. 
 


 


THINKING ABOUT YOU

 Been thinking about you, 
the way I cut your hair 
Your eyes are on my wall, 
your teeth are over there 
 
But I'm still no one, 
and you're my star 
 
What do you care? 
 
Been thinking about you, 
and there's no rest 
 
Should I still love you, 
still see you in bed 
 
When I'm playing with myself? 
What do you care 
when the other men are far, far better? 
 
All the things you got, 
all the things you need 
I bought you cigarettes, 
and pried the company 
to come and see you, 
honey 
 
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep? 
Those people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet 
They don't know what I know. 
Why should you care when I'm not there? 
 
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest 
Should I still love you, still see you in bed 
When I'm playing with myself? 
What do you care when I'm not there? 
 
All the things you got 
that you'll never need 
all the things you got 
I bled and 
I bleed to please you 
 
Been thinking 
about you...

 


THIS MESS WE'RE IN

 Can you hear them? 
The helicopters? 
I m in New York 
No need for words now 
We sit in silence 
You look me 
In the eye directly 
You met me 
I think it s Wednesday 
The evening 
The mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me 
 
Night and day 
I dream of 
Making love 
To you now baby 
Love making 
On screen 
Impossible dream 
And I have seen 
The sunrise 
Over the river 
The freeway 
Reminding 
Of this mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me 
 
What were you wanting? 
I just want to say 
Don t ever change now baby 
And thank you 
I don t think we ll ever meet again 
And you must leave now 
Before the sunrise 
Above skyscrapers 
The sin and 
The mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me 


 


TRANS ATLANTIC DRAWL

 I was born for your magazines 
For your magazines 
I am trapped in the society page 
Of your magazines 
Of your magazines 
I don't know what it means 
 
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel? 
At the end of the tunnel? 
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel? 
At the end of the tunnel? 
At the end of the tunnel? 


 


TREEFINGERS

 (Instrumental)

 


TRUE LOVE WAITS

 i'll drown my beliefs 
to have you be in peace 
i'll dress like your niece 
to wash your swollen feet 
 
just don't leave 
don't leave 
 
and true love waits 
in haunted attics 
and true love wins 
on lollipops and crisps 
 
just don't leave 
don't leave 
 
i'm not living 
i'm just killing time 
your tiny hands 
your crazy kiss and smile 
 
just lonely, longing

 


UP ON THE LADDER

 monster in the ?????? 
trapped in our birth space 
a man sleep timing 
the mixture of mother craze 
 
all the right moves and in the right percent 
watch my dog, a puppet 
looking as it's seen a strain 
 
give me an answer 
give me a line 
i've been climbing up this high 
i've been wasting my time 
 
climb up the ladder 
up the ladder 
up 
climb, climb up the ladder 
up the ladder 
up on the ladder 
it's my time to escape 
 
up on the ladder 
away from your mistake 
 
up on the ladder 
to call out the pain 
 
up on the ladder 
you're all the fucking same 
 
oh, you let the people down 
you let the people down 
you let the people down 
 
oh, you let the people down 
you let the people down 
you let the people down 
 


 


VEGETABLE

 I never wanted anything like this 
I worked hard, tried hard 
I ran around in domestic bliss 
I fought hard, died long 
 
Every time you're running out of here 
Every time you're running I get the fear 
 
I never wanted any broken bones 
Scarred face, no home 
Your words surround me and asphyxiate 
And I burn all hate 
 
Every time you're running out on me 
Every time you're running I can see 
 
I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself 
 
The waters spray, the waters roll all over me 
The waters spray, the waters roll on this tired [?] 
 
I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself

 


WE SUCK YOUNG BLOOD

 are you hungry? 
are you sick? 
are you begging for a break? 
 
are you sweet? 
are you fresh? 
are you strung up by the wrists? 
 
we want the young blood 
 
are you fracturing? 
are you torn at the seams? 
would you do anything? 
flea bitten? motheaten? 
 
we suck young blood 
we suck young blood 
 
won't let the creeping ivy 
won't let the nervous bury me 
our veins are thin 
our rivers poisoned 
 
we want the sweet meats 
we want the young blood 
 


 


WHERE BLUEBIRDS FLY

 (Instrumental)

 


WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN

 there's a gap in between 
there's a gap where we meet 
where i end and you begin 
 
and i'm sorry for us 
the dinosaurs roam the earth 
the sky turns green 
where i end and you begin 
 
i am up in the clouds 
i am up in the clouds 
and i can't and i can't come down 
 
i can watch but not take part 
where i end and where you start 
where you, you left me alone 
you left me alone. 
 
X' will mark the place 
like parting the waves 
like a house falling in the sea. 
 
i will eat you all alive 
i will eat you all alive 
i will eat you all alive 
i will eat you all alive 
 
there'll be no more lies 
there'll be no more lies 
there'll be no more lies 
there'll be no more lies 
 


 


WICKED PEOPLE

 Go to hell come to me 
For I am a wicked child 
I sin and I so confuse 
And I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
 
I am the devil's son 
And I wish I could be good 
Keep you satisfied 
Yeah I wish I could be good 
I wish I could be good 
 
Go to hell and come to me 
For I am a wicked child 
I sin and I so confuse 
Yeah I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
 
????? 
I wanna be good 
I wanna be good. 
 


 


WOLF AT THE DOOR

 Drag him out the window 
dragging out your dead 
singing i miss you 
snakes and ladders 
flip the lid 
out pops the cracker 
smacks you in the head 
knifes you in the neck 
kicks you in the teeth 
steel toe caps 
takes all your credit cards 
step up get the gunge 
get the eggs 
get the flan in the face 
the flan in the face 
the flan in the face 
dance you fucker dance you fucker 
don't you dare 
don't you dare 
don't you flan in the face 
take it with the love its given 
take it with a pinch of salt 
take it to the taxman 
let me back let me back 
i promise to be good 
don't look in the mirror 
at the face you don't recognize 
help me call the doctor 
put me inside 
put me inside 
put me inside 
put me inside 
put me inside 
 
i keep the wolf from the door 
but he calls me up 
calls me on the phone 
tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up 
steal all my children 
if i don't pay the ransom 
but i'll never see him again 
if i squeal to the cops 
 
walking like a giant crane and 
with my x ray eyes i strip you naked 
in a tight little world and are you on the list? 
stepford wives who are we to complain? 
investments and dealers investments and dealers 
cold wives and mistresses. 
cold wives and sunday papers. 
city boys in 1st class 
don't know we're born 
just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up 
born and raised for the job 
oh I wish you'd get up 
go over get up go over and turn this tape off. 
 
i keep the wolf from the door 
but he calls me up 
calls me on the phone 
tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up 
steal all my children 
if i don't pay the ransom 
but i'll never see him again 
if i squeal to the cops 
 


 


WORRYWORT

 You don't wanna talk to me, 
You don't wanna say the words, 
You try to get off the hook, 
You try to get off the hook. 
Sprawling on a pin, 
Hanging off the hook, 
Trying to get yourself away, 
Trying to get yourself away. 
 
There's no use dwelling on, 
On what might have been, 
Just think of all the fun, 
You could be having. 
 
We know the way you talk, 
We know what you want, 
We know what you want, 
What you really wanted. 
 
Take a look around, 
There's candles on the cake, 
On what might have been, 
The road you should have took, 
Mistakes mistaken 
 
There's no use dwelling on, 
No use dwelling on. 
 
It's such a beautiful day, 
It's such a beautiful day, 
Find yourself a ????, 
Go and get some rest. 
 
It's such a beautiful day. 
It's such a beautiful day. 
Go up to the mic, 
Go up to the mic, 
Go and get some rest. 
 


 


YES I AM

 I resent you calling 
I resent your voice 
I resent that I 
Don't have a choice 
 
Anywhere I go 
You are always there 
Outside the car 
Or in my hair 
 
I think I've been here before 
Yes I've been here before 
The last time you locked 
All the doors 
 
And I resent you calling 
I resent your voice 
I resent that I 
Don't have a choice 
 
And yes I am 
Yes I am 
 
I think I've told you once 
I think I needed advice 
You were such a help 
That's very nice 
 
I think I've been here before 
Yes I've been here before 
But this time I kick 
Down your door 
 
Yes I am 
Yes I am 


 


YOU

 You are the sun the moon and stars 
ah you... and I could never run away from you 
 
You try but what could get out of things? 
and why should I believe myself? 
not you? 
It's like the world is gonna end so soon 
and why should I believe myself? 
 
Yeah... 
 
You, me, and everything caught in the fire 
I can see you drowning 
caught in the fire

 


YOU AND WHOSE ARMY?

 Come on, come on You think you drive me crazy Come on, come on You and whose army? You and your cronies Come on, come on Holy roman empire Come on if you think Come on if you think You can take us all on You can take us all on You and whose army? You and your cronies You forget so easily You ought to know You ought to know Oh so sad Oh so sad Oh so sad You ought to know You ought to know I'm so sad I'm so sad I'm so sad.. 


YOU NEVER WASH UP AFTER YOURSELF

 I must get out once in a while 
Everything is starting to die 
The dust settles, the worms dig 
Spiders crawl over the bed 
 
I must get out once in a while 
I eat all day and now I'm fat 
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plate 
You never wash up after yourself
