'87 AND CRY

 
 
It's just a one dollar secret 
A lover's secrets in the UK 
Torn apart in the UK 
In the dribble of May Day 
'87 and Cry 
'87 and Cry 
And there's nothing inside 
And there's nothing in mind 
And only you 
Rocket on thru the sky 
It couldn't be done 
without dogs 
It couldn't be once 
without us 
'87 and Cry 
'87 and Cry 
 
When the days were the days were the days boys 
When blue ties 
were for the biggy guys 
Frannie dressing down for the enemy 
You saw him hangin' on the enemy 
And there's no one in love 
And there's nowhere to scream 
And only you 
Race on to wonder where 
It couldn't be done without dogs 
It couldn't be once without us 
'87 and Cry 
'87 and Cry 
You can't make love with money 
You can't make mistakes with babies 
Nothing looked good on you 
That's how I liked you best 
Now you're ready for the real McCoy 
 
Deep in the heart of Cupid 
Murders on the heels of love 
Just the ghost of a story 
Just a one dollar secret 
Baby these were the sounds 
Baby these were the sounds 
And only you 
Whisper these things aren't true 
It couldn't be done with dogs 
It couldn't be once without us 
'87 and Cry 
'87 and Cry 
 


 


1984

 
 
Someday they won t let you, so now you must agree 
The times they are a telling, 
and the changing isn t free 
You ve read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV 
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984 
 
They ll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air 
And tell that you re eighty, but brother, you won t care 
You ll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow s neverthere Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984 
 
CHORUS 
Come see, come see, remember me? 
 
We played out an all night movie role 
 
You said it would last, but I guess we 
enrolled 
 
In 1984 (who could ask for more) 
1984 (who could ask for mor or or or ore) 
(Mor or or or ore) 
 
I m looking for a vehicle, I m looking for a ride 
I m looking for a party, I m looking for a side 
 
I m looking for the treason that I knew in 65 
 
 
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984 
 
CHORUS 
 
1984 (ad lib) 


 


5.15 THE ANGELS HAVE GONE

 () 
 
5:15 
I'm changing trains 
This little town 
Let me down 
This foreign rain 
Brings me down 
 
5:15 
Train overdue 
Angels have gone 
No ticket 
I'm jumping tracks 
I'm changing towns 
We never talk anymore 
Forever I will adore you 
 
5:15 
All of my life 
Angels have gone 
I'm changing trains 
Angels like them 
Thin on the ground 
All of my life 
All legs and wings 
Strange sandy eyes 
 
5:15 
Train overdue 
Angels have gone 
We never talk anymore 
Forever I will adore you 
Cold station 
All of my life 
Forever I'm out here forever 


 


A BETTER FUTURE

 () 
 
Please don't tear this world asunder 
Please take back 
this fear we're under 
I demand a better future 
Or I might just stop wanting you 
I might just stop wanting you 
Please make sure we get tomorrow 
All this pain and all the sorrow 
I demand a better future 
Or I might just stop needing you 
I might just stop needing you 
Give my children sunny smile 
Give them moon and cloudless sky 
I demand a better future 
Or I might just stop loving you, 
loving you, loving you 
When we talk, we talk to you 
When we walk, we walk to you 
From factory to field 
How many tears must fall 
Down there below 
Nothing is moving 
Oo o 
I might just stop wanting you 
I might just stop needing you 
I might just stop loving you 
I demand a better future 
I demand a better future 
I demand a better future 
For I might just stop loving you, 
loving you, loving you 
I demand a better future 
I demand a better future 
I demand a better future 
For I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you 
I demand a better future

 


A BIG HURT

 
 
To meet her once just to know it through and through 
I know, I know 
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings 
I know, I know 
 
How can I help you? 
You're just a wanna be 
I'm a believer 
You're a sex receiver 
And me with a big hurt 
You know I had a big hurt 
From the very start 
I'm hurting so bad 
'Cause you're my roommate 
from hell 
 
CHORUS 
Got to take some blows on the stepping stones 
Speak in extremes 
It'll save you time 
You were a saint abroad 
But a devil at home 
Come on here, woo woo 
And kiss it for me 
 
To meet her once just to know it 
through and through 
I know, I know 
Even a glass eye 
in a duck's ass 
can see that 
 
I know, I know 
 
How can I help you? 
I'm hit with a big hurt 
You know I had 
A great big hurt 
From the very start 
I'm hurting so bad 
And here come the indians oooo 
 
CHORUS 
 
Kiss it for me, woo woo 
Kiss it for me 
Woo woo, kiss it for me 
Come on here, woo woo 
Kiss it for me 
Kiss it where it counts 
Kiss it for me 
Come on here, woo woo 
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, woo woo 
Kiss it for me 


 


A FOGGY DAY IN LONDON TOWN

 I was a stranger in the city 
Out of town were the people I knew 
I had that feeling 
of self pity 
What to do? What to do? What to do? 
The outlook was decidedly blue 
But as I walked 
through the foggy streets alone 
It turned out to be the luckiest day 
I've known 
 
A foggy day in London Town 
Had me low and had me down 
I viewed the morning 
with alarm 
The British Museum had lost 
its charm 
How long, I wondered, 
could this thing last? 
But the age of miracles hadn't passed, 
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town 
The sun was shining everywhere.

 


A SMALL PLOT OF LAND

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Poor soul 
Spit upon that 
Poor soul 
He never knew what hit him 
And it hit him so 
Poor dunce 
He pushed back the pigmen 
The Barbs laughed 
The fool is dead 
 
Poor dunce 
He's less than within us 
The brains talk 
But the will to live is dead 
And prayer can't travel 
so far 
these days 
The talk of your life 
Standing so near 
To innocent eyes 
Poor dunce 
 
Swings thru the tunnels 
And claws his way 
Is small life so manic 
Are these really the days 
Poor dunce 
Poor dunce 
 
VERSE 
 
Poor soul 
Poor soul 
Poor soul 


 


ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS

 I've nothing much to offer 
There's nothing much to take 
I'm an absolute beginner 
And I'm absolutely sane 
As long as we're together 
The rest can go to hell 
I absolutely love you 
But we're absolute beginners 
With eyes completely open 
But nervous all the same 
 
CHORUS 
If our love song 
Could fly over mountains 
Could laugh at the ocean 
(2nd time)sail over heartaches 
Just like the films 
There's no reason 
To feel all the hard times 
To lay down the hard lines 
It's absolutely true 
 
Nothing much could happen 
Nothing we can't shake 
Oh we're absolute beginners 
With nothing much at stake 
As long as you're still smiling 
There's nothing more I need 
I absolutely love you 
But we're absolute beginners 
But if my love is your love 
We're certain to succeed 
 
CHORUS

 


ACROSS THE UNIVERSE

 (John Lennon Paul McCartney) 
 
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup 
They slither wildly as they slip away 
Across the universe 
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind 
Possessing and caressing me 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
Nothing s gonna change my world 
Nothing s gonna change my world 
Images of broken light which dance before me like a 
Million eyes 
They call me on and on 
Across the universe 
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter 
box 
They tumble blindly as they make their way 
Across the universe 
 
CHORUS 1 (twice) 
 
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my 
open ears 
Inciting and inviting me 
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns 
It calls me on and on and on 
Across the universe 
 
CHORUS (twice) 


 


AFRAID

 () 
 
I wish I was smarter 
I got so lost on the shore 
I wish I was taller 
Things really matter to me 
 
But I put my face in tomorrow 
I believe we're not alone 
I believe in Beatles 
I believe my little soul has grown 
And I'm still so afraid 
 
Yes, I'm still so afraid 
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own 
On my own 
What made my life so wonderful? 
What made me feel so bad? 
I used to wake up the ocean 
I used to walk on clouds 
If I put faith in medication 
If I can smile a crooked smile 
If I can talk on television 
If I can walk an empty mile 
Then I won't feel afraid 
No, I won't feel afraid 
I won't be Be afraid 
Anymore 
Anymore 
Anymore

 


AFRICAN NIGHT FLIGHT

 African nightmare one time Mormon 
More men fall in Hullabaloo men 
I slide to the nearest bar 
Undermine chairman I went too far 
Bent on a windfall rent a sony 
Wonder how the dollar went down 
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father 
Hey no, he wished me well 
 
CHORUS 1 (two times) 
 Seemed like another day 
 I could fly into the eye of god on high 
 
CHORUS 2 (two times) 
 His burning eye will see me through 
 One of these days, one of these days 
 Gotta get a word through one of these days 
 
CHORUS 3 (two times) 
 Asanti habari habari habari 
 Asanti nabana nabana nabana 
 
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight 
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing 
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino 
Born in slumber less than peace 
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming 
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine 
Sick of you, sick of me 
Lust for the free life 
Quashed and maimed 
Like a valuable loved one 
Left unnamed 
 
CHORUS 1 (two times) 
 
Over the bushland over the trees 
Wise like Orangutan that was me 
 
CHORUS 2 (two times) 
 
CHORUS 3 (repeat ad inf.)

AFTER ALL

 
 
Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo 
 
There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo 
 
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 
 
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own 
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl 
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 
 
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo 
 
After all, after all 


 


ALADDIN SANE

 (1913 1938 197?) 
(Bowie) 
 
 
Watching him dash away, 
swinging an old bouquet 
 dead roses 
Sake and strange divine Uh h h uh h uh you'll make it 
Passionate bright young things, 
takes him away to war 
don't fake it 
Saddening glissando strings 
Uh h h uh h uh you'll make it 
 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
 
Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell I'm waiting 
Clutches of sad remains 
Waits for Aladdin Sane you'll make it 
 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise 
 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
 
We'll love Aladdin Sane 
Love Aladdin Sane 
 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise 
 
Who'll love Aladdin Sane 
 
We'll love Aladdin Sane 
We'll love Aladdin Sane 


 


ALGERIA TOUCHSHRIEK

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
My name is Mr. Touchshriek 
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy 
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and 
empty females 
 
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg 
A reject from the world wide Internet 
 
He's a broken man 
I'm also a broken man 
 
It would be nice to have company 
We could have great conversations 
Looking through windows for demons 
And watching the young advance in all electric 
 
Some of the houses around here 
still have inhabitants in them 
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not 
I don't get to speak much to anyone 
or that sort of thing 
If I had another broken name 
Oh, I dream of something like that 


 


ALL THE MADMAN

 
 
Day after day 
They send my friends away 
To mansions cold and grey 
To the far side of town 
Where the thin men stalk the streets 
While the sane stay underground 
 
 
Day after day 
They tell me I can go 
They tell me I can blow 
To the far side of town 
Where it's pointless to be high 
'Cause it's such a long way down 
So I tell them that 
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm 
 
I will do me harm 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all...am I? 
 
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be 
Just my librium and me 
And my E.S.T. makes three 
 
 
'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free 
 
And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me 
 
(Where can the horizon lie 
When a nation hides 
Its organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim 
They must be very dim) 
 
 
Day after day 
They take some brain away 
Then turn my face around 
To the far side of town 
And tell me that it's real 
Then ask me how I feel 
 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all 
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be 
My libido's split on me 
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy 
 
'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen 
Roaming free And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content 
They're all as sane as me 
Zane, Zane, Zane Ouvre le Chien (rpt) 


 


ALL THE YOUNG DUDES

 Well Billy rapped all night 
about his suicide 
How he'd kick it in the head 
when he was twenty five 
Speed jive don't want to stay alive 
When you're twenty five 
And Wendy's stealing clothes 
from Marks and Sparks 
(unlocked cars) 
And Freedy's got spots (zits) 
from ripping off the stars from his face 
Funky little boat race 
Television man is crazy 
saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks 
Oh man I need TV

'cause he dresses like a queen 
But he can kick like a mule

mean team 
But we can love 
oh yes we can love 
And my brother's back at home 
with his Beatles and his Stones 
We never got it off 
on that revolution stuff 
What a drag 
too many snags 
Now I've drunk a lot of wine 
and I'm feeling fine 
Got to race

Oh is there concrete all around 
Or is it in my head

ALWAYS CRASHING IN THE SAME CAR

 
 
Every chance, 
every chance that I take 
I take it on the road 
Those kilometres and the red lights 
I was always looking left and right 
Oh, but I'm always crashing 
in the same car 
 
Jasmine, I saw you peeping 
As I pushed my foot down to the floor 
I was going round and round the hotel garage 
Must have been touching close to 94 
Oh, but I'm always crashing 
in the same car 


 


AMAZING

 (D.Bowie/R.Gabrels) 
 
I'm lazy 
You're crazy, girl 
Stay by my side 
 
I'm scared you'll 
Meet someone 
In whom you'll confide 
 
CHORUS 
Life's still a dream 
Your love's amazing 
Since I found you 
My life's amazing 
 
I pledge you 
You'll never be blue 
There's too much at stake to be down 
 
My nightmare 
Rooted here 
watching you go 
Divine in both our lives 
 
CHORUS 
My life's a roll 
Go go go 
And it's amazing 


 


AMLAPURA

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Hey hey it's the tall sail on 
On a beach reach for Java 
Make way for to Java 
Watching for Boogies 
Hey hey it's a dreaming 
I would burn you if you should die 
Hey hey I would burn too 
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre 
 
CHORUS 
I dream of Amlapura 
Never saw in all my life 
a more shining jewel 
I dream of Amlapura 
Of an ocean or dream of a princess 
in stone 
 
Hey hey golden roses around 
A rajah's mouth 
Hey hey all the dead children 
buried standing 
A flying Dutchman 
Smoking gun and spice wind 
 
CHORUS 


 


AMSTERDAM

 In the port of Amsterdam 
There's a sailor who sings 
Of the dream that he brings 
From the wide open sea 
In the port of Amsterdam 
There's a sailor who sleeps 
While the river bank weeps 
To the old willow tree 
In the port of Amsterdam 
There's a sailor who dies 
Full of beer, full of cries 
In a drunken town fight 
In the port of Amsterdam 
There's a sailor who's born 
On a hot muggy morn 
By the dawn's early light 
In the port of Amsterdam 
Where the sailors all meet 
There's a sailor who eats 
Only fish heads and tails 
And he'll show you his teeth 
That have rotten too soon 
That can haul up the sails 
That can swallow the moon 
And he yells to the cook 
With his arms open wide 
 Hey, bring me more fish 
Throw it down by my side 
And he wants so to belch 
But he's too full to try 
So he stands up and laughs 
And he zip up his fly 
In the port of Amsterdam 
You can see sailors dance 
Paunches bursting their pants 
Grinding women to porch 
They've forgotten the tune 
That their whiskey voice 
croaked 
Splitting the night 
With the roar of their jokes 
And they turn and they dance 
And they laugh and they lust 
Till the rancid sound 
of the accordion bursts 
And then out of the night 
With their pride in their pants 
And the sluts that they tow 
Underneath the street lamps 
In the port of Amsterdam 
There's a sailor who drinks 
And he drinks and he drinks 
And he drinks once again 
He'll drink to the health 
Of the whores of Amsterdam 
Who've given their bodies 
To a thousand other men 
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue 
Their goodness all gone 
For a few dirty coins 
Well he just can't go on 
Throws his nose to the sky 
And he aims it up above 
And he pisses like I cry 
On the unfaithful love 
In the port of Amsterdam 
In the port of Amsterdam

 


AN OCCASIONAL DREAM

 
 
I recall how we lived 
On the corner of a bed 
And we'd speak of a Swedish room 
Of hessian and wood 
And we'd talk with our eyes 
Of the sweetness in our lives 
And tomorrows of rich surprise... 
Some things we could do 
 
In our madness 
We burnt one hundred days 
Time takes time to pass 
And I still hold some ashes to me 
An Occasional Dream 
 
And we'd sleep, oh so close 
But not really close our eyes 
'Tween the sheets of summer 
bathed in blue... 
Gently weeping nights 
It was long, long ago 
And I can't touch your name 
 
For the days of fate 
were strong for you... 
Danced you far from me 
 
In my madness 
I see your face in mine 
I keep a photograph 
It burns my wall with time 
Time 
An Occasional Dream 
Of mine 
An Occasional Dream 
Of mine 
An Occasional Dream 
Of mine 


 


ANDY WARHOL

 
 
Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema 
Dress my friends up 
just for show 
See them as they really are 
Put a peephole in my brain 
Two New Pence to have a go 
I'd like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show 
 
CHORUS 
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all 
 
Andy walking, Andy tired 
Andy take a little snooze 
Tie him up when he's fast asleep 
Send him on a pleasant cruise 
When he wakes up on the sea 
Be sure to think of me and you 
He'll think about paint 
and he'll think about glue 
What a jolly boring thing to do 
 
CHORUS 


 


ANYWAY, ANYHOW, ANYWHERE

 (Pete Townshend/Roger Daltrey) 
 
 
CHORUS 
I can go anyway 
(way I choose) 
I can live anyhow 
(win or lose) 
I can go anywhere 
(for something new) 
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose 
 
I can do anything 
(right or wrong) 
I can talk anyhow 
(and get along) 
I don't care anyway 
(I never lose) 
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose 
 
Nothing gets in my way 
Not even locked doors 
Don't follow the lines 
that been laid before 
I get along anyway I care 
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere 
 
CHORUS 
 
Anyway, anyway I choose 
I wanna go 
Do it myself, do it myself, 
Anyway, anyway I choose 


 


AS THE WORLD FALLS DOWN

 () 
 
There's such a sad love 
Deep in your eyes, 
a kind of pale jewel 
Open and closed within your eyes 
I'll place the sky within your eyes 
 
There's such a fooled heart 
Beating so fast in search of new dreams 
A love that will last within your heart 
I'll place the moon within your heart 
 
CHORUS 
As the pain sweeps through 
Makes no sense for you 
Every thrill has gone 
Wasn't too much fun at all 
But I'll be there for you oo oo 
As the world falls down 
 
Falling 
(As the world) Falling down 
Falling in love 
 
I'll paint you mornings of gold 
I'll spin you Valentine evenings 
Though we're strangers till now 
We're choosing the path between the stars 
I'll leave my love between the stars 
 
CHORUS 
 
Falling 
(As the world) Falling down

ASHES TO ASHES

 
 
Do you remember a guy that's been 
In such an early song 
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control 
Oh no, don't say it's true 
 
They got a message 
from the Action Man 
 I'm happy, hope you're happy too 
I've loved 
all I've needed to love 
Sordid details following 
 
The shrieking of nothing is killing 
Just pictures of Jap girls 
in synthesis and I 
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair 
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing 
 
CHORUS 
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky 
We know Major Tom's 4 
a junkie 
Strung out in heaven's high 
Hitting an all time low 
 
Time and again I tell myself 
I'll stay clean tonight 
But the little green wheels are following me 
Oh no, not again 
I'm stuck with a valuable friend 
 I'm happy, hope you're happy too 
One flash of light 
but no smoking pistol 
 
I never done good things 
I never done bad things 
I never did anything out of the blue, 
Want an axe to break the ice 
Wanna come down right now 
 
CHORUS 
 
My mother said 
to get things done 
You'd better not mess 
with Major Tom 


 


BABY CAN DANCE

 (D.Bowie) 
 
I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel 
No one looks and no one feels 
But the baby can the baby can 
 
The way it feels just feeling you 
Holding out and falling out 
But the baby can the baby can 
 
CHORUS 
I'm the jumping man 
I'm the jumping man 
But baby can float 
Baby can drown 
Baby can touch her toes 
Toss her hair 
Make you feel you're going nowhere 
Baby can dance 
Baby can dance 
Baby can walk around the town 
Attract a man and cut him down 
 
I'm the shadow man the jumping jack 
The man who can and don't look back 
But the baby can the baby can 
 
I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel 
No one looks and no one feels 
But the baby can the baby can 
 
CHORUS 
And the way it feels 
I'm feeling you 
 
Everyday is far away 
Everyday, everyday 
It's over now 
It's over now 


 


BABY GRACE (A HORRID CASSETTE)

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Test, testing, testing 
This, hmmm, Grace is my name 
And and I was...um... 
It was that phot... a fading photograph of a patch..., a patchwork quilt. 
And they've put me on these... 
Ramona put me on 
these interest drugs 
 
So I'm thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch 
 
And ah they won't let me see anybody 
If I want to sometimes ... and I ask 
I can still hear some pop...popular musics and aftershocks. (Ahhh choo) 
See I've been watching a television of um... 
in the homelands 
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember 
And now they just want me to be quiet 
And I think something is going to be horrid 


 


BABY LOVES THAT WAY

 [Baby loves that way] 
Yes, she does, yes, she does 
[Baby loves that way] 
Oh, I love my baby 
[Baby loves that way] 
Ooh, I gotta take her 
[Baby loves that way] 
Yep, I love her 
 
Baby likes to go outside, 
so I let her 
Wants to fool with other guys, 
so I let her 
Wants to be bad, 
so I let her be bad 
But fooling around, it will make me sad 
She fools around with other boys 
and treat me 
like an unwanted toy 
 
[Baby loves that way] 
Oh, I love my baby 
[Baby loves that way] 
Ooh, she does too much to me 
[Baby loves that way] 
And I can't think too much of her 
[Baby loves that way] 
Gotta take her, gotta take her 
 
Gonna better leave her alone, 
put you down son 
Treating her real fine, 
thus I'm home being a loner 
J eanny's my babe and that's alright, 
yeah 
She treats me good, each and every night 
She fools around with other boys 
and treat me 
like an unwanted toy 
 
[Baby loves that way] 
I love my baby 
[Baby loves that way] 
Ooh, she's too much 
[Baby loves that way] 
Yes she does, yes she does 
[Baby loves that way] 
[Baby loves that way] 
I love my baby 
[Baby loves that way] 
Yeah, she's too much, yeah yeah 
[Baby loves that way] 
Ooh, I think she can live with me 
[Baby loves that way] 
Love her, love her, love her 
 
Baby likes to go outside, 
so I let her 
Wants to fool with other guys, 
so I let her 
Wants to be bad, 
so I let her be bad 
But fooling around, it will make me sad 
She clings around 
with all the boys, 
who treat her 
like a modern toy 
 
[Baby loves that way] 
Obviously this is the end 
[Baby loves that way] 
Gotta take her 
[Baby loves that way] 
Ooh yeah 
[Baby loves that way] 
Can't do enough 
[Baby loves that way]

BANG BANG

 (Pop/Kraal) 
 
Wow this ain't the right thing to do so let's go 
 
Young girls they know what they're after 
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye 
Rockets shooting up into space 
Buildings they rise to the skies 
 
Bang Bang I got mine 
Bang Bang reach for the sky 
 
I keep a good friend on videotape 
He'll drive his sports car 
until it's too late 
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight 
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet 
 
Bang Bang I got mine 
Bang Bang sun don't shine 
Bang Bang you all angels 
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures 
 
Oh girl 
Oh girl my problems 
can't follow me 
Phone calls I take my machine 
I wander lonely to the sea 
Lonely Ha Ha what does it mean 
 
Bang Bang I got mine 
Bang Bang and you are next in line 
Bang Bang reach for the sky 
Bang Bang sun don't shine 
 
Rise buildings 
Rise to the sky 
Young girls they know what they're after 
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye 


 


BATTLE FOR BRITAIN (THE LETTER)

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels/Plati Lyrics Bowie) 
 
My, my, the time do fly 
When it's in another pair of hands 
And a loser I will be 
For I've never been 
a winner in my life 
I got used to stressing pain 
I used the sucker pills 
to pity for the self 
Oh, it's the animal in me 
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf 
 
Don't be so forlorn, 
it's just the payoff 
It's the rain before the storm 
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand 
And I'll walk you through the doors 
Don't be so forlorn, 
it's just the payoff 
It's the rain before the storm 
 
Don't you let my letter get you down 
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you 
 
My, my, but time do fly 
When it's in another pair of pants 
And illusion I will be 
For I've never been a sinner, 
la di da 
 
Don't be so forlorn, 
it's just the payoff 
It's the rain before the storm 
Don't you let my letter get you down 
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you 
 
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down 
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you 
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down 


 


BE MY WIFE

 
 
Sometimes you get so lonely 
Sometimes you get nowhere 
I've lived all over the world 
I've left every place 
 
 
Please be mine 
Share my life 
Stay with me 
Be my wife 
 
Sometimes you get so lonely 
Sometimes you get nowhere 
I've lived all over the world 
I've left every place 
 
 
Please be mine 
Share my life 
Stay with me 
Be my wife 
 
Sometimes you get so lonely 


 


BEAT OF YOUR DRUM

 
 
Photograph king, watches you go 
Fashions may change, heaven knows, 
but you still leave a stain on me 
Supplement queen, 
your colours may fade 
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a 
mark on me 
 
Wrong negative fades never the twain, reckless and tame 
 
I like the beat of your drum 
I like to look in your eyes 
I like to look thru your things 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
 
I like the smell of your flesh 
I like the dirt that you dish 
I like the clothes that you wear 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
 
Disco brat follow the pack 
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all 
this greedy intention 
 
Vanity's child picture you now 
Music may change hi di ho keen to follow your nose 
 
Wrong love out of tune 
Sweet is the night, 
bright light destroys me 
 
CHORUS 
I like the beat of your drum 
I like to look in your eyes 
I like to look thru your things 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
 
I like the smell of your flesh 
I like the dirt that you dish 
I like the clothes that you wear 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
I like your face in the crowd 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
I'd like to beat on your drum 
I'd like to blow on your horn 
I'd like to beat on your drum 


 


BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUNG

 
 
Psychodelicate girl come out to play 
Little metal faced boy 
don't stay away 
They're so war torn and resigned 
she can't talk any more 
 
What are they trying to prove? 
What would they like to find? 
 
It's love back to front and no sides 
like I say 
These pieces are broken like I say 
These pieces are broken 
Hope I'm wrong but I know 
 
CHORUS 
Because you're young 
you'll meet a stranger some night 
Because you're young 
what could be nicer for you 
and it makes me sad 
So I'll dance my life away 
A million dreams, a million scars 
 
He punishes hard 
was loving her such a crime 
She took back everything she said 
Left him nearly out of his mind 
They're people I know people I love 
They seem so unhappy dead or alive 
 
It's love back to front and no sides 
like I say 
These pieces are broken like I say 
These pieces are broken 
Hope I'm wrong but I know 
 
CHORUS 
 
A million dreams 
A million scars 
A million (repeat ad inf.) 


 


BETTY WRONG

 (Bowie/ Gabrels) 
 
Till the sun blisters and sprays 
And every lamb ceases to graze 
When the kiss of the comb 
Tears my face from the bone 
 
CHORUS 
I'll be your light 
When the shadows fall down the walls 
Then life will be done 
And it just won't matter at all 
 
I was carved from a hand 
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams 
Now your breath fills my step 
Now there is you till life is gone 
 
CHORUS 
I'll roll your ball 
Till the stars 
can't make me cry 
Then life will be done 
And it just won't matter at all 
Not at all 
 
When the kiss of the comb 
Tears my face 


 


BIG BROTHER

 
 
 
Don t talk of dust and roses 
Or should we powder our noses? 
Don t live for last year s capers 
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal 
 
He ll build a glass asylum 
With just a hint of mayhem 
He ll build a better whirlpool 
We ll be living from sin, 
then we can really begin 
 
Please saviour, saviour, show us 
Hear me, I m graphically yours 
 
CHORUS 
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo 
 
Someone to fool us, someone like you 
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother 
 
 
I know you think you re awful square 
 
But you made everyone and you ve been every where 
Lord, I d take an overdose if you knew what s going down 
 
CHORUS (3 times) 
 
We want you Big Brother 


 


BLACK COUNTRY ROCK

 
 
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on 
Black Country Rock 
 
You never know, you might find it here on 
Black Country Rock 
 
 
Some say the view is crazy 
But you may adopt another point of view 
So if it's much too hazy 
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu 


 


BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE

 
 
Getting my facts from a Benetton ad 
I'm lookin' thru African eyes 
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire 
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang 
Bang I've got you babe 
Sun comes up and the man goes down 
And the woman comes again 
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear 
Then we jump thru hoops, we're 
divisible now, just disappear 
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands 
Then die in the flames singing we 
shall overcome 
Whoa! What's going on? 
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it 
I look into your eyes and I know 
you won't kill me 
You won't kill me 
You won't kill me 
But I look into your eyes 
And I wonder sometimes 
 
Oh Lord, just let him see me 
Lord, Lord just let him hear me 
Let him call me brother 
Let him put his arms around me 
Let him put his hands together. 
 
Reach over race and hold each 
other's hands 
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world 
Woa! What's going on? 
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it 
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me 
You won't kill me 
You won't kill me 
But I wonder why 
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes 
 
They'll show us how to break the rules 
But never how to make the rules 
Reduce us down to witless punks 
Facist cries both black and 
white, who's got the blood, 
who's got the gun. 
 
Putting on the black tie, cranking 
out the white noise 
(Just a fool!) 


 


BLEED LIKE A CRAZE, DAD

 
 
Shine shine shine (x6) 
 
Bleeds like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 
 
Easy come, come, 
gotta back 
In the valley 
of the dead man walks 
How they drank from the jazz 
 
Astral, Kestrel, 
Fed into the featherfall 
Fed him on a pencil carving 
You will never get 
 
Shine shine shine 
Bleed like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 
Shine shine shine 
Bleed like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 
 
Seek for a leather journey 
Never stopped to think about 
Hollywood King Kong 
Domino on the side 
 
Street light, looking right 
Looking to the parlous parlours 
Party on the dead 
Put a net through his headache 
 
Shine shine shine (x3) 
 
Blee eed, bleed like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 
 
Living on a movie 
All the Shirley/Charley films on film 
Come together, party 
Footnote on the footstone 
 
Shine shine shine 
Bleeds like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 
 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
 
CHORUS (x6) 
Bleed like a craze, Dad 
These are the craze 


 


BLUE JEAN

 
 
Blue Jean I just met me a girl named Blue Jean 
 
Blue Jean she got a camouflaged face and no money 
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em 
 
Oh, Blue Jean is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean 
She got a police bike 
She got a turned up nose 
 
Sometimes I feel like 
(Oh, the whole human race) 
Jazzin' for Blue Jean 
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue) 
Blue Jean can send me 
(Oh, somebody send me) 
Somebody send me 
(Oh, somebody send me) 
 
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter 
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together 
Remember that everybody has to wait in line 
Blue Jean look out world you know I've got mine 
She got Latin roots 
She got everything

BREAKING GLASS

 (Bowie/Davis/Murray) 
 
Baby, I've been 
breaking glass 
In your room again 
Listen 
 
Don't look at the carpet, 
I drew something awful on it 
 
See 
 
You're such a wonderful person 
But you got problems oh oh oh oh 
I'll never touch you 
 


 


BRING ME THE DISCO KING

 You promised me the ending would be clear 
You'd let me know when the time was now 
Don't let me know when you're opening the door 
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear 
 
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell 
Stab you from the city spires 
Life wasn't worth the balance 
Or the crumpled paper it was written on 
 
Don't let me know we're invisible 
Don't let me know we're invisible 
 
Hot cash days that you trailed around 
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass 
Led me down river of perfumed limbs 
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls 
 
Don't let me know we're invisible 
Don't let me know we're invisible 
We could dance, dance, dance thru' the fire 
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire 
 
Feed me no lies 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Breathe through the years 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Bring me the disco king 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king 
 
Spin offs with those who slept like corpses 
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs 
Killing time in the '70s 
Smelling of love through the moist winds 
Don't let me know when you're opening the door 
Close me in the dark, let me disappear 
Soon there'll be nothing left of me 
Nothing left to release 
 
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire 
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire 
Feed me no lies 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Breathe through the years 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Bring me the disco king 
I don't know about you, I don't know about you 
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king 
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king

 


BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA

 
 
Living in lies 
by the railway line 
Pushing the hair from my eyes 
Elvis is English and climbs the hills 
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies 
Screaming along in South London 
Vicious but ready to learn 
Sometimes I fear 
that the whole world is queer 
Sometimes but always in vain 
 
CHORUS 
So I'll wait 
until we're sane 
Wait until we're blessed 
and all the same 
Full of blood, loving life 
and all it's got to give 
 
Englishman going insane 
Down on my knees in suburbia 
Down on myself in every way 
 
With great expectations 
I change all my clothes 
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold 
Screaming above Central London 
Never bored, 
so I'll never get old 
 
CHORUS 
 
Day after 
Day after 
Day 
Day after 
Zane, Zane, Zane 
Ouvre le chien 
Day after 
Day 
Day after 
Zane, Zane, Zane 
Ouvre le chien 
Day after 


 


BUS STOP

 (D.Bowie/R.Gabrels) 
 
There's a cry that is heard in the city 
From Vivian at Pentecost Lane 
A shriekin' and dancing till 4 am 
Another night of muscles and pain 
I love you despite your convinctions 
That god never laughs at my jokes 
 
I'm a young man at odds 
with the bible 
But I don't pretend faith never works 
When we're down on our knees 
Prayin' at the bus stop 
 
Now Jesus he came in a vision 
And offered redemption from sin 
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you 
But are you sure that it really was him 
I've been told that it could've been 
blue cheese 
 
Or the meal that we ate down the road 
Hallelujah 
 


 


CACTUS

 (Francis Black) 
 
Sitting here 
wishing on a cement floor 
Just wishing that 
i had just something you wore 
I put it on when I go lonely 
Will you take off your dress 
and send it to me? 
 
I miss your kissin' 
and i miss your head 
And a letter in your writing 
doesn't mean you're not dead 
 
Just run outside in the desert heat 
Make your dress all wet 
and send it to me 
I miss your soup and I miss your bread 
And a letter in your writing 
doesn't mean you're not dead 
So spill your breakfast 
and drip your wine 
Just wear that dress when you dine 
 
D A V I D 
 
So, sitting here wishing 
on a cement floor 
Just wishing that i had just something you wore 
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree 
Wipe'em on your dress 
and send it to me 
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor 
Just wishing that i had just something you wore

CAN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT ME

 Question time that says 
I brought dishonor 
My head's bowed in shame 
It seems that 
I've blackened the family name 
Mother says that 
she can't stand the neighbors' talking 
 
I've gotta pack my bags, 
leave this home, 
start walking, yeah 
I'm guilty 
I wish that I was sorry this time 
I wish that I could pay for my crime 
 
I can't help 
thinking about me 
 
Remember when we used to go 
to church on Sundays 
I lay awake at night, 
terrified of school 
on Mondays 
Oh, but it's too late now 
I wish I was a child againI wish 
I felt secure again 
 
I can't help 
thinking about me 
 
As I pass a recreation ground 
I remember my friends, 
always been found 
and I can't 
 
I can't help 
thinking about me 
 
Now I leave them all 
in the never never land 
The station seems so cold, 
the ticket's in my hand 
My girl calls my name 
 Hi Dave 
Drop in, see you around, come back 
If you're this way again 
Oh, I'm on my own 
I've got a long way to go 
I hope I make it on my own 
 
I can't help 
thinking about me

 


CANDIDATE

 
 
I ll make you a deal, like any other candidate 
 
We ll pretend we re walking home cause your future s at stake 
My set is amazing, it even smells like a 
street 
There s a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend 
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of les tricoteuses 
Who wrote up scandals in other bars 
 
I m having so much fun with the poisonous people 
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up 
 
Some make you sing and some make you scream 
One makes you wish that you d never been seen 
But there s a shop on the corner that s selling papier mach� 
Making bullet proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay 
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing 
So you scream out of line 
 I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? 
Any time? 
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty, I want you 
When it s good, it s really good, and when it s bad I go to pieces 
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing 
 
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head 
For I put all I have in another bed 
On another floor, in the back of a car 
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar 
Well, I guess we ve must be looking for a different kind 
 
But we can t stop trying til we break up our minds 
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights 
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright 
 
I guess we could cruise down one more time 
 
With you by my side, it should be fine 
 
We ll buy some drugs and watch a band 
 
Then jump in the river holding hands 


 


CAT PEOPLE (PUTTING OUT FIRE)

 (Giorgio Moroder/) 
 
See these eyes so green 
I can stare for a thousand years 
Colder than the moon 
It's been so long 
And I've been putting out fire 
With gasoline 
 
Feel my blood enraged 
It's just the fear of losing you 
Don't you know my name 
Well, you been so long 
 
See these eyes so red 
Red like jungle burning bright 
Those who feel me near 
Pull the blinds and change their minds 
It's been so long 
 
Still this pulsing night 
A plague I call a heartbeat 
Just be still with me 
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru 
You've been so long 
Well it's been so long 
And I've been putting out fire 
with gasoline 
putting out fire 
with gasoline 
 
See these tears so blue 
An ageless heart 
that can never mend 
These tears can never dry 
A judgement made 
can never bend 
See these eyes so green 
I can stare for a thousand years 
Just be still with me 
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru 
 
You've been so long 
Well, it's been so long 
And I've been putting out fire 
with gasoline 
putting out fire with gasoline 


 


CHANGES

 
 
I still don't know what I was waiting for 
And my time was running wild 
A million dead end streets 
Every time I thought I'd got it made 
It seemed the taste 
was not so sweet 
So I turned myself to face me 
But I've never caught a glimpse 
Of how the others must see the faker 
I'm much too fast to take that test 
 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Don't want to be a richer man 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Just gonna have to be a different man 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time 
 
I watch the ripples change their size 
But never leave the stream 
Of warm impermanence and 
So the days float through my eyes 
But still the days seem the same 
And these children that you spit on 
As they try to change their worlds 
Are immune to your consultations 
They're quite aware 
of what they're going through 
 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Where's your shame 
You've left us up to our necks in it 
Time may change me 
But you can't trace time 
 
Strange fascination, fascinating me 
Changes are taking the pace 
I'm going through 
 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers 
Ch ch ch ch Changes 
(Turn and face the stranger) 
Ch ch Changes 
Pretty soon you're gonna get 
a little older 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time 
I said that time may change me 
But I can't trace time

Hip swayin', trouble makin', booty shakin', tripping, passing, jumping 
Bouncing, drivin', stylin', creeping, pouncing, shoutin', screamin'

CHINA GIRL

 (Bowie/Iggy Pop) 
 
 
I could escape this feeling 
with my China girl 
I feel a wreck 
without my little China girl 
I hear her heart beating 
loud as thunder 
Saw they stars crashing 
 
I'm a mess 
without my little China girl 
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl 
I hear her heart's beating 
loud as thunder 
Saw they stars crashing down 
 
I feel a tragic 
like I'm Marlon Brando 
When I look at my china girl 
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much 
When I look at my China girl 
 
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow 
Visions of swasticas in my head 
Plans for everyone 
It's in the white of my eyes 
 
My little China girl 
You shouldn't mess with me 
I'll ruin everything you are 
I'll give you television 
I'll give you eyes of blue 
I'll give you man who wants to rule the world 
 
And when I get excited 
My little China girl says 
Oh baby just you shut your mouth 
She says sh sh shhh 


 


COME AND BUY MY TOYS

 
 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men s children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You ve watched your father plough the field with a ram s horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threshed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he d work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching s over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father s land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you ll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 


 


CONVERSATION PIECE

 I took this walk 
to ease my mind 
To find out what's gnawing at me 
Wouldn't think, to look at me, 
That I've spent a lot of time in education 
It all seems so long ago 
I'm a thinker, not a talker 
I've no one to talk to, anyway 
 
I can't see the road 
for the rain in my eyes 
Ahhh huh, h...uh, huh 
 
I live above the grocers store, 
Owned by an Austrian 
He often calls me down to eat 
And he jokes about his broken English, 
Tries to be a friend to me 
But for all my years 
of reading conversation, 
I stand without a word to say 
 
I can't see the bridge 
For the rain in my eyes 
Ahhh huh, h...uh, huh 
 
And the world is full of life 
Full of folk who don't know me 
And they walk in twos or threes or more 
While the light 
that shines above the grocer's store 
Investigates my face so rudely 
And my essays lying 
scattered on the floor 
Fulfill their needs just by being there 
And my hands shake, my head hurts, 
my voice sticks inside my throat 
I'm invisible and dumb 
No one will recall me 
 
And I can't see the water 
Through the tears in my ey y yes 
Ahhh huh, h...uh, huh

 


CRACK CITY

 (D.Bowie) 
 
Oh come all you children 
Don't grab that scabby hand 
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and tell 
It belongs to the candyman 
Don't whore your little bodies 
To the worms of paradise 
Like Everest it's fatal 
Its peaks are cold as ice 
They're riding on the subways 
They're riding on the streets 
They'll ride you down to the gutters 
They'll ride you off your feet 
 
CHORUS 
Gonna hit Crack City (Hit Crack City) 
 
Piss on the icon monsters 
Whose guitars bequeath you pain 
They'll face you down to their level 
With their addictions and their fast lanes 
Corrupt with shaky visions 
And crack and coke and alcohol 
They're just a bunch of assholes 
With buttholes for their brains 
You can't keep on riding 
The pain you know so well 
They'll ride you down to the gutter 
They'll ride you down to hell 
 
CHORUS 
And you the master dealer 
May death be on your brow 
May razors slash your mainline 
I'm calling you out right now 
May all your vilest nightmares 
Consume your shrunken head 
May the ho ho hounds of paranoia 
Dance upon your stinking bed 
Don't look at me you fuckhead 
This nation's turning blue 
Its stink it fouls the highways 
Its filth it sticks like glue 
 
CHORUS 
They'll bury you in velvet 
And place you underground 
The hatred of yourself 
And the sufferings that conspire 
To take your little body and throw it to the fools 
And the hounds that rip your flesh 
Only your mind can take you out of this 
Only your mind or death 
 
I'm riding on the subway 
The subway down to hell 
I've finished with this journey 
I seem to know it well 


 


CRACKED ACTOR

 
 
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs 
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had 
 
I'm stiff on my legend, 
the films that I made 
Forget that I'm fifty 
cause you just got paid 
 
CHORUS 
Crack, baby, crack, 
show me you're real 
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel 
Suck, baby, suck, 
give me your head 
Before you start professing 
that you're knocking me dead 
 
You caught yourself a trick down 
on Sunset and Vine 
But since he pinned you baby 
you're a porcupine 
 
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques 
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex 
 
CHORUS 


 


CRIMINAL WORLD

 (Peter Godwin/Duncan Browne/Sean Lyons) 
 
You never told me of your other faces 
You were the widow of a wild cat 
And now I know about your special kisses 
And I know you know where that's at 
I guess I recognize your destination 
I think I see beneath your make up 
What you want is sort of separation 
This is no ordinary 
This is no ordinary 
(ah, ah, ah) 
What a criminal world 
The boys are like baby faced girls 
What a criminal girl 
She'll show you where to shoot your gun 
What a typical mother's son 
The only thing that she enjoys 
Is a criminal worl 
Where the girls are like baby faced boys 
 
You've got a very heavy reputation 
But no one knows about your low life 
I know a way 
to find a situation 
And hold a candle 
to your high life disguise 
You caught me kneeling 
at your sister's door 
That was no ordinary stick up 
I'm well aware just 
what you're looking for 
I am no ordinary 
I am no ordinary 
(ah, ah, ah) 
What a criminal world 
The boys are like baby faced girls 
What a criminal girl 
She'll show you where to shoot your gun 
What a typical mother's son 
The only thing that she enjoys 
Is a criminal world 
Where the girls are like baby faced boys 


 


CYGNET COMMITTEE

 
 
I bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes 
I love you badly, 
Just in time, at times, I guess 
Because of you I need to rest 
Because it's you 
that sets the test 
 
So much has gone 
and little is new 
And as the sparrow sings 
Dawn chorus for 
Someone else to hear 
The Thinker sits alone growing older 
And so bitter 
 
 I gave Them life 
I gave Them all 
They drained my very soul 
...dry 
I crushed my heart 
to ease Their pains 
No thought for me remains there 
Nothing can They spare 
What of me? 
Who praised Their efforts 
to be free? 
Words of strength and care 
and sympathy 
I opened doors 
that would have blocked Their way 
I braved Their cause to guide, 
for little pay 
 
I ravaged at my finance just for Those 
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility 
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free 
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me 
 
I bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes 
I love you badly, just in time, 
at times, I guess 
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes 
Because it's you 
that sets the test 
 
So much has gone 
and little is new 
And as the sunrise stream 
Flickers on me, 
My friends talk 
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word 
 
 We had a friend, a talking man 
Who spoke of many powers that he had 
Not of the best of men, but Ours 
 
We used him 
We let him use his powers 
We let him fill Our needs 
Now We are strong 
 
And the road is coming to its end 
Now the damned have no time to make amends 
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way 
The silent guns of love 
will blast the sky 
We broke the ruptured structure built of age 
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage 
 
Where money stood 
We planted seeds of rebirth 
And stabbed the backs of fathers 
Sons of dirt 
 
Infiltrated business cesspools 
Hating through Our sleeves 
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat 
Stoned the poor 
on slogans such as 
 
'Wish You Could Hear' 
'Love Is All We Need' 
'Kick Out The Jams' 
'Kick Out Your Mother' 
'Cut Up Your Friend' 
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End' 
 
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above 
And We Can Force You to Be Free 
And We Can Force You to Believe 
 
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain 
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain 
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain 
It said: 
 I believe in the Power of Good 
I Believe in the State of Love 
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right 
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right 
 
And I open my eyes to look around 
And I see a child laid slain 
on the ground 
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows 
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command 
But not hearing anymore 
Not hearing anymore 
Just the shrieks from the old rich 
 
And I Want to Believe 
In the madness that calls 'Now' 
And I want to Believe 
That a light's shining through 
Somehow 
 
And I Want to Believe 
And You Want to Believe 
And We Want to Believe 
And We Want to Live 
Oh, We Want to Live 
 
We Want to Live 
We Want to Live 
We Want to Live 
We Want to Live 
We Want to Live 
 
I Want to Live 
I Want to Live 
I Want to Live 
 
I Want to Live 
I Want to Live 
I Want to Live 
 
Live 
Live 
Live 


 


D.J.

 (Lyrics by Bowie 
Music by Bowie/Eno/Alomar) 
 
I'm home, lost my job, 
and incurably ill 
You think this is easy realism 
I've got a girl out there, I suppose 
I think she's dancing 
Feel like Dan Dare lies down 
I think she's dancing, what do I know? 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me 
 
One more weekend of lights 
and evening faces 
Fast food, living nostalgia 
Humble pie or bitter fruit 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no 
I am a D.J., I am what I say 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I've got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no (kiss kiss) 
 
Time flies when you're having fun 
Break his heart, break her heart 
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer 
I am a D.J., and I've got believers 
 
I've got believers 
I've got believers 
I've got believers in me 
I've got believers 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I am a D.J. 


 


DANCING WITH THE BIG BOYS

 (Bowie/Pop/Alomar) 
 
Something's going on in society 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
One wrong word and you're out of sync 
Talking bout a hands on policy 
(Big boys) 
Death to the trees 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
They weren't bad, they weren't brave 
Nothing is embarrassing 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
There are too many people, too much belief 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
Where there's trouble there's poetry 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
Your family is a football team 
(Big boys) 
This dot marks your location 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
Loneliness in a free society 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
(Big boys) 
This can be embarrassing 
(Big boys) 
(Dancing with the big boys) 
(Big boys) 
(Big boys) 


 


DAY IN DAY OUT

 
 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
 
Day In Oo Oo 
Day Out Oo Oo Oo 
 
She was born in a handbag 
Love left 
on a doorstep 
What she lacks is a backup 
Nothing seems to make a dent 
Gonna find her some money honey 
Try to pay her rent 
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about 
 
CHORUS 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
 
Day In Oo Oo 
Day Out Oo Oo Oo 
 
First thing she learns is 
she's a citizen 
Some things they turn out right 
When you're under the USA 
Something rings a bell 
and it's all over 
She's going out her way 
Stealing for that one good rush 
 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
 
She could use a little money 
She's hangin' on his arms 
like a cheap suit 
She's got no money, honey 
She's on the other side 
Oh come on little baby 
Late night, big town, 
police, shake down 
 
Oo Oo 
Oo Oo 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
Oo Oo 
Oo Oo 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
 
She's got a ticket to nowhere 
She's gonna take a train ride 
Nobody knows her, or knows her name 
 
 
She's in the pocket of a home boy 
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow 
Spin the grail spin the drug 
She's gonna make them well aware 
She's an angry gal 
 
Day In Day Out 
Stay In Fade Out 
 
Suddenly there's angels everywhere 
Angels in a ton of sound 
And they shootin' her down 
Shootin her with video drugs bullets and promises 


 


DAYS

 Hold me tight 
Keep me cool 
Going mad 
Don't know what to do 
Do I need a friend? 
Well, I need one now 
 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
 
All I've done 
I've done for me 
All you gave 
You gave for free 
I gave nothing in return 
And there's little left of me 
 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
 
In red eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again 
My crazy brain in tangles 
Pleading for your gentle voice 
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart 
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul 
 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you

 


DEAD AGAINST IT

 
 
And when she drowns 
Within and in the fizzy gin, 
begins to sigh 
 
 Good god or My 
I cry and die and lie 
beside 
 
She is the apple in my eye 
She talked to god 
I couldn't cope 
Or'd hope eloped 
A dope she roped 
This salty lie 
 
CHORUS 
And when she's dreaming, I believe 
And when she's reading, I retreat 
Can't believe her 
Telling me she's dead again 
Telling me she's dead against it 
 
And deep my wound 
Within for every second chance 
it was deign torn 
 
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn 
 
She loves to talk into the phone 
No matter who 
No matter when 
No matter where 
No better than the faulty line 
 
CHORUS 


 


DEAD MAN WALKING

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels Lyrics Bowie) 
 
He swivels his head 
Tears his eyes from the screen 
As his past puts him back 
in Atlantic City 
There's not even a demon 
in Heaven or Hell 
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Now I'm older than movies 
Let me dance away 
Now I'm wiser than dreams 
Let me fly fly fly 
While I'm touching tomorrow 
And I know who's there 
When silhouettes fall 
 
And I'm gone 
Like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone 
through a crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 
 
Two young men dancing under the lamplight 
Shaking their sex and their bones 
And the boys that we were 
An alien nation in therapy 
Sliding naked and new 
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
And I'm older than movies 
Oh let me dance dance dance 
Now I'm wiser than dreams 
Let me fly fly fly 
While I'm touching tomorrow 
And I know who's there 
When silhouettes fall 
And I'm gone 
 
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone, 
through the crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man 
Like a dead man walking 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Let me dance dance dance 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Let me dance dance dance 
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone, 
through a crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 


 


DIAMOND DOGS

 
 
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent 
You asked for the latest party 
 
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump 
Dressed like a priest you was 
Todd Browning s freak you was 
 
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee 
I m sure you re not protected, for it s plain to see 
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees 
Hunt you to the ground they will, 
mannequins with kill appeal 
 
CHORUS 
(Will they come?) I ll keep a friend serene 
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come unto me 
(Will they come?) 
Well, she s come, been and gone. 
 
Come out of the garden, baby 
You ll catch your death in the fog 
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs 
 
 
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat 
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase 
 
The elevator s broke, so he slides down a rope 
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go 
 
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach 
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch 
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake 
 
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized 
 
CHORUS 
 
 
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch 
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the Ditch 
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch 
(There s gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow 
 
CHORUS 
 
 
Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2) 
Bow wow, woof woof, bow wow, wow 
Call them the Diamond Dogs (ad lib) 
 
Keep cool Diamond Dogs rule, OK 
Beware of the Diamond Dogs (repeat) 


 


DJ

 I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill 
You think this is easy, realism 
I've got a girl out there, I suppose 
I think she's dancing 
Feel like Dan Dare lies down 
I think she's dancing, what do I know? 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me, oh 
 
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces 
Fast food, living nostalgia 
Humble pie or bitter fruit 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I say 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I've got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no (kiss kiss) 
 
Time flies when you're having fun 
Break his heart, break her heart 
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer 
I am a D.J., and I've got believers 
 
I've got believers 
I've got believers 
I've got believers in me 
I've got believers 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I am a D.J.

 


DODO

 Now we can talk in confidence 
Did you guess 
that we've been done wrong? 
Lies jump in queue 
to be first in line 
Such a shameless design 
Ah, thinks he's well screened 
from the man at the top 
It's a shame 
that his children disagree 
They coolly decide 
to sell him down the line 
Daddy's brainwashing time 
 
He's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
He's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
 
She's quite enthralled 
with her childhood of yore 
When a unit was a figure, not a she 
When lovers chose each other, 
now the perks are due 
Another memo to screw 
 
She's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
She's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Can you wipe your nose my child 
Without them 
slotting in your file a photograph? 
Can you sleep alone at night? 
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim 
He's come to turn you in 
 
Another dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Another dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Ah, another do do, no, 
didn't hear itdo do, do do

 


DON T LET ME DOWN AND DOWN

 (Tahra / Valmont) 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
No place to hide no way to fall 
Nowhere to lie no world so wide 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
 
I know there's something in the wind 
That crazy balance of my mind 
What kind of fool are you and I? 
Scared to death and tell me why 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
 
You made a date with destiny 
You jog jog in my memory 
You haunt in mind not fade away 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
No place to hide, no way to fall 
Nowhere to lie no world so wide 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 


 


DON'T BRING ME DOWN

 (Johnnie Dee) 
 
I'm on my own, nowhere to roam 
I tell you baby, don't want no home 
I wander round, feet off the ground 
I even go from town to town 
I said I think 
this rock is grand 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
 
I met this chick, the other day 
And then to me, she said she'll stay 
I get this pad, just like a cave 
And then we'll have, our living made 
And then I'll lead her on the ground 
My head is spinning round 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
 
I, I, I, I, I need a lover 
'cause someone new 
 
And then to her I will be true 
I'll buy her furs and pretty things 
I'll even buy a wedding ring 
But until then I'll ?settle down? 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
Until then I'll ?settle down? 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
Don't bring me down 


 


DON'T LOOK DOWN

 (Pop/Williamson) 
 
Don't look down 
They're making sorta crazy sounds 
Don't look down, no 
Don't know who else came to kneel 
On this empty battlefield 
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I always hear that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
 
I went this morning to the cemetery 
To see old Rudy 
Valentino buried 
Lipstick traces on his name 
He never looked down 
'Cause they were making crazy sounds 
From Central Park to shanty town 
He always heard that crazy sound 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
 
When I see you standing there 
I can't see the clothes you wear 
I just hear that crazy sound 
And I can't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I've always heard that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
Don't look down 
Don't look, don't look down 
 
No I won't be bored I won't be there 
Look at life it's no piece of cake 
When I hear that crazy sound 
I don't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I always hear that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down 
Don't look down, no 
Well, don't look, 
don't look down 


 


DRIVE IN SATURDAY

 
 
Let me put my arms 
around your head 
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed 
Don't forget to turn on the light 
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright 
Pour me out another phone 
I'll ring and see 
if your friends are home 
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome 
Can lend us a book we can read up alone 
 
And try to get it on like once before 
When people stared in Jagger's eyes 
and scored 
Like the video films we saw 
 
CHORUS 
His name was always Buddy 
And he'd shrug and ask to stay 
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid 
And turn her face away 
She's uncertain if she likes him 
But she knows she really loves him 
It's a crash course for the ravers 
It's a Drive in Saturday 
 
Jung the foreman prayed at work 
That neither hands nor limbs would burst 
It's hard enough to keep formation 
amid this fall out saturation 
 
 
Cursing at the Astronette 8 
Who stands in steel 
by his cabinet 
He's crashing out with Sylvian 
The Bureau Supply 
for ageing men 
 
With snorting head he gazes to the shore 
Which once had raised a sea 
that raged no more 
Like the video films we saw 
 
CHORUS 
It's a Drive in Saturday (repeat)

 


EIGHT LINE POEM

 
 
The tactful cactus by your window 
Surveys the prairie of your room 
The mobile spins to its collision 
Clara puts her head between her paws 
They've opened shops down West side 
Will all the cacti find a home 
But the key to the city 
Is in the sun that pins 
the branches to the sky 


 


EVERYONE SAYS HI

 () 
 
Said you took a big trip 
They said you moved away 
Happened oh, so quietly 
They say 
 
Shoulda took a picture 
Something I could keep 
Buy a little frame 
Something cheap 
For you 
 
Everyone says hi 
 
Said you sailed a big ship 
Said you sailed away 
Didn't know the right thing 
To say 
 
I'd love to get a letter 
Like to know what's what 
Hope the weather's good 
And it's not too hot 
For you 
 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
 
Everyone says 
Don't stay in a sad place 
Where they don't care how you are 
Everyone says hi 
 
If the money is lousy 
You can always come home 
We can do the old things 
We can do all the bad things 
If the food gets you leery 
You can always phone 
We could do all the good things 
We could do it, we could do it, 
we could do it 
Don't stay in a bad place 
Where they don't care how you are 
 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
And the girl next door 
And the guy upstairs 
Everyone says hi 
And your mum and dad 
Everyone says hi 
And your big fat dog 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
Hi hi hi hi

FALL DOG BOMBS THE MOON

 Hope little girl 
Come blow me away 
I don't care much 
I win anyway 
Just a dog 
 
I'm God damn rich 
An exploding man 
When I talk in the night 
There's oil on my hands 
What a dog 
 
Fall dog is cruel and smart 
Smart time breaks the heart 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
 
Devil in a market place 
Devil in your bleeding face 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
What a dog 
 
There's always a moron 
Someone to hate 
A corporate tie 
A wig and a date 
Just a dog 
 
These blackest of years 
That have no sound 
No shape, no depth 
No underground 
What a dog 
 
Fall dog is cruel and smart 
Smart time breaks the heart 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
 
A devil in a market place 
A devil in your bleeding face 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
What a dog

 


FAME

 (Bowie/Lennon/Alomar) 
 
Fame, makes a man take things over 
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow 
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow 
Fame 
Fame, it s not your brain, it s just the flame 
That burns your change to keep you insane 
Fame 
Fame, what you like is in the limo 
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow 
Fame, what you need you have to borrow 
Fame 
Fame, Nein! It s mine! is just his line 
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime 
Fame 
Could it be the best, could it be? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe? 
Really, really? 
Is it any wonder I reject you first? 
Fame, fame, fame, fame 
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool 
 
Fame 
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me 
Got to get a rain check on pain 
Fame 
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, 
fame 
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, 
fame 
Fame, fame, fame 
Fame 
What s your name? 
 
 
(whispered): 
 
Feeling so gay, feeling gay? 
Brings so much pain?

 


FANTASTIC VOYAGE

 (Lyrics by Bowie 
Music by Bowie/Eno) 
 
In the event 
that this fantastic voyage 
Should turn to erosion 
and we never get old 
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable 
But our lives are valuable too 
 
We're learning to live with somebody's depression 
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression 
We'll get by, I suppose 
It's a very modern world, 
but nobody's perfect 
 
It's a moving world, 
but that's no reason 
To shoot some of those missiles 
Think of us as fatherless scum 
It won't be forgotten 
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we? 
 
And the wrong words make you listen 
In this criminal world 
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable 
But our lives are valuable too 
 
We're learning to live with somebody's depression 
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression 
We'll get by I suppose 
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down 
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down 
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down 
And it won't be forgotten 
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

FASCINATION

 (words by Bowie and Luther Vandross / music by Luther Vandross)

Fascination moves sweeping near me 
Still I take ya

FASHION

 
 
There's a brand new dance 
but I don't know its name 
That people from bad homes 
do again and again 
It's big and it's bland 
full of tension and fear 
They do it over there but we don't do it here 
 
CHORUS 
Fashion! Turn to the left 
Fashion! Turn to the right 
Oooh, fashion! 
We are the goon squad 
and we're coming to town 
Beep beep 
Beep beep 
 
Listen to me don't listen to me 
Talk to me don't talk to me 
Dance with me don't dance with me, no 
Beep beep 
 
There's a brand new talk, 
but it's not very clear 
That people from good homes 
are talking this year 
It's loud and tasteless 
and I've heard it before 
You shout it while you're dancing 
on the whole dance floor 
Oh bop, fashion 
 
CHORUS 
 
Listen to me don't listen to me 
Talk to me don't talk to me 
Dance with me don't dance with me, no 
Beep beep 
Beep beep 
 
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do 
Fa fa fa fa fashion 
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do

FIVE YEARS

 
 
Pushing thru the market 
square 
so many mothers sighing 
News had just come over, 
we had five years left to cry in 
 
News guy wept and told us 
earth was really dying 
Cried so much his face was wet 
then I knew he was not lying 
 
 
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies 
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s 
My brain hurt like a warehouse 
it had no room to spare 
I had to cram so many things 
to store everything in there 
And all the fat skinny people, and all the tall short people 
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people 
I never thought I'd need so many people 
 
A girl my age went off her head 
hit some tiny children 
If the black hadn't a pulled her off, I think she would have killed them 
 
 
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac 
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest 
and a queer threw up at the sight of that 
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour 
drinking milk shakes cold and long 
Smiling and waving and looking so fine 
don't think you knew you were in this song 
 
 
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor 
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there 
Your face, your race, the way that you talk 
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk 
 
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes 
We've got five years, what a surprise 
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot 
We've got five years, that's all we've got 


 


FRIDAY ON MY MIND

 (Young/Vanda) 
 
Monday morning feels so bad 
Everybody seems to nag me 
Coming Tuesday I feel better 
Even my old man looks good 
Wednesday just don't go 
Thursday goes too slow 
I've got Friday on my mind 
 
CHORUS 
(See my baby) 
Gonna have fun in the city 
(feel like fucking you) 
(Do my baby screw) 
Be with my girl 
she's so pretty 
(all I want to do) 
(I'll go crazy) 
She looks fine tonight 
(zoom zoom zoom) 
She is out of sight to me (so divine) 
(Tonight) I spend my bread 
(Tonight) I lose my head 
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight 
Monday I have Friday on my mind 
 
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue) 
 
There is nothing else that bugs me 
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar 
man, thief) 
Hey I'll change that scene one day 
Today I might be mad 
Tomorrow I'll be glad 
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind 
 
CHORUS 
 
(See my baby) (feel like fucking you) 
Gonna have fun 
(zoom zoom zoom) 
Be with my girl (repeat ad lib.) 


 


FUTURE LEGEND

 
 
And in the death 
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy 
thoroughfare 
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building 
High on Poacher s Hill 
And red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City 
No more big wheels 
 
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats 
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes 
Coverting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers 
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love Me Avenue 
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers 
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald 
Any day now 
The Year of the Diamond Dogs 
 
 This ain t Rock n Roll 
This is Genocide 


 


GEMINI SPACESHIP

 (Legendary Stardust Cowboy) 
 
I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And boy, I really felt blue 
 
Two or three flying saucers 
Parked under the stars 
The winding stream 
Moon shining down 
On some little town 
And with each beam 
The same old dream 
 
I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And I thought about you 
I pulled down my sun visor 
Boy, I really felt blue 
 
You jumped into your Gemini 
I jumped into mine 
We'll orbit the moon 
For just one time 
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night 
Will you hold hands 
With me in the moonlight 
 
I took a trip 
in a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And I thought about you 
I took 
I took a walk in space 
Boy, I really felt blue 
 
Well, I peeked through the crack 
And I looked way back 
The stardust trail 
Leading back to you 
What did I do 
What could I do 
Yes what did I do 
 
Well 
I thought about you 
I thought about you 
Took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
Thought about you 


 


GLASS SPIDER

 
 
Up until one century ago there lived, 
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country 
A glass like spider 
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons 
over its web 
In weeks creating a macabre 
Shrine of remains 
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers 
Like floors in a building 
 
At the top of this palace like place, assembled with 
almost apparent 
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew drops 
One could almost call it an altar 
When the breeze blew 
thru this construction 
It produced sounds of wailing, crying 
Tiny wails, tiny cries 
 
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother. 
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies 
Would survive somehow 
on their own. 
Oh The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like a human's. 
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries. 
 
Don't you hear this wasted cry, 
Life is over you 
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone) 
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell 
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now) 
Take care, take care. 
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone) 
 
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone. 
But you, you've promise 
in your lovin' eye. 
 
God it's dark now. 
 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
 
Gone, Gone the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, 
savage and afraid 
Spitting the dawn, come come come along 
before the animals awake 
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left. 
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might 
Gone, gone, the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 
 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
 
Gone gone the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 


 


GOD KNOWS I'M GOOD

 
 
I was walking through the counters of a national concern 
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder 
 
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean 
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared 
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak 
Into the paper bag at her side 
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed 
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind 
 
Crying 
 God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God may look the other way today 
 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God may look the other way today 
 
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag 
Perspiration trickled down her forehead 
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder 
She was led away bewildered and amazed 
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter 
As her escort asked her softly 
for her name 
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady 
Who had fainted to the whirling 
wooden floor 
 
Crying 
 God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
Surely God won't look 
the other way 
 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
Surely God won't look 
the other way 


 


GOD ONLY KNOWS

 (Brian Wilson/Tony Asher) 
 
If you should ever leave me 
My life would still go on believe me 
The world could show nothing to me 
So what good would living do me 
God only knows what I'd be without you 
 
I may not always love you 
But as long as there are 
stars above you 
You'll never need to doubt it 
I'll make you so sure about it 
God only knows what I'd be without you 


 


GOLDEN YEARS

 
 
 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

Run for the shadows in these golden years 
 
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years 
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold 
Golden years, gold whop whop whop (Repeat) 


 


GOODBYE MR. ED

 (Bowie/H. Sales/T. Sales) 
 
The ghost of Manhattoes 
Shrieking as they fall 
From AT&T 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
Andy's skull enshrined 
In a shopping mall near Queens 
Someone sees it all 
 
Icarus takes his pratfall 
Bruegel on his head 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
Four and twenty black kids 
Some of them are blind 
Someone sees it all 
Tolerance of violence 
By the fellows with no heads 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
Some things are so big 
They make no sense 
Histories so small 
People are so dense 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
Never mind the Pistols 
They laid the Golem eggs 
Others came to hatch them 
Outside the pale 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 


 


HALLO SPACEBOY

 (Music: Bowie/Eno Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
(Hallo) Spaceboy, 
you're sleepy now 
Your silhouette is so stationary 
You're released but your custody calls 
And I want to be free 
Don't you want to be free 
Do you like girls or boys 
It's confusing these days 
But Moondust will cover you 
Cover you 
 
This chaos is killing me 
 
CHORUS 
So bye bye love 
Yeah bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Yeah bye bye love 
This chaos is killing me 
 
And the chaos is calling me 
Yeah bye bye love 
 
CHORUS 
 
This chaos is killing me (x2) 
 
Yeah bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Good time love 
Be sweet sweet dove 
Bye bye spaceboy 
Bye bye love 
 
Moondust will cover you (repeat ad. inf) 
 


 


HANG ON TO YOURSELF

 
 
Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the 
show tonight 
Praying to the light machine 
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky thigh 
collector 
Layin' on 'lectric dreams 
 
CHORUS 
So come on, come on 
we've really got a good thing going 
Well come on, well come on 
If you think we're gonna make it 
You better hang on to yourself 
 
We can't dance, we don't talk much 
We just ball and play 
But then we move like tigers on vaseline 
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar 
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars 
 
 
CHORUS (x3) 
 
Come on, ah, come on, ah (repeat ad inf.) 


 


HEATHEN

 () 
 
Steel on the skyline 
Sky made of glass 
Made for a real world 
All things must pass 
Oo o 
Waiting for something 
Looking for someone 
Is there no reason? 
Have I stared too long? 
Oo oOo o 
You say you'll leave me 
And when the sun is low 
And the rays high 
I can see it now 
I can feel it die 
Oo oOo o

 


HEAVEN'S IN HERE

 (D.Bowie) 
 
Baby I dream 
between the blade and the tongue 
Of the rose on your cheek, the wounded and dumb 
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall 
Skin on skin but there's heaven in... 
 
CHORUS 
Heaven's in here (x2) 
Among the twilight and stars 
Like a rocket to mars 
Heaven in here 
 
The first and the last are telling it all 
Telling you loud but selling it small 
I'm taking a swing 
at this shadow of mine 
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth .... But it's here 
 
CHORUS 
Heaven in one sigh 
Heaven in two eyes 
 
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs 
The rustle of your falling gown 
We stumble and fall 
like tragedy falls 
We stumble and twirl 
there's heaven in here 
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall 
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in... 
Heaven's in here 
 
CHORUS 
You'll dance to my tongue 
we'll dance on the sun 
We're the twilight and stars 
There's heaven in here 


 


HERE COMES THE NIGHT

 (Bert Berns) 
 
 
Ohhhhh... here it comes 
Here comes the night 
Yeah, here comes the night 
Oh, yeah (here comes the night) 
 
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl 
With another guy 
His arms around her 
like it used to be with me 
Oh it makes me want to die 
 
CHORUS 
Yeah, here it comes 
Here comes the night 
Yeah, here comes the night 
Yeah... (here comes the night) 
 
There they go, funny how they look so good together 
Wonder what is wrong with me 
Why can't I accept 
the fact she's chosen him 
And simply let them be? 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh she's with him 
they're turning down the lights 
Now he's holding her the way I used to do 
I can see her closing her eyes 
and telling him lies 
Exactly like she told me too 
 
CHORUS (repeat ad inf.) 


 


HEROES

 I, I will be king 
And you, you will be queen 
Though nothing will drive them away 
We can beat them, just for one day 
We can be Heroes, just for one day 
 
And you, you can be mean 
And I, I'll drink all the time 
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact 
Yes we're lovers, and that is that 
 
Though nothing, will keep us together 
We could steal time, 
just for one day 
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever 
What d'you say? 
 
I, I wish you could swim 
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim 
Though nothing, 
nothing will keep us together 
We can beat them, for ever and ever 
Oh we can be Heroes, 
just for one day 
 
I, I will be king 
And you, you will be queen 
Though nothing will drive them away 
We can be Heroes, just for one day 
We can be us, just for one day 
 
I, I can remember (I remember) 
Standing, by the wall (by the wall) 
And the guns shot above our heads 
(over our heads) 
And we kissed, 
as though nothing could fall 
(nothing could fall) 
And the shame was on the other side 
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever 
Then we could be Heroes, 
just for one day 
 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
Just for one day 
We can be Heroes 
 
We're nothing, and nothing will help us 
Maybe we're lying, 
then you better not stay 
But we could be safer, 
just for one day 
 
Oh oh oh ohh, oh oh oh ohh, 
just for one day

 


HURT

 I hurt myself today 
To see 
if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that's real 
The needle tears a hole 
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember everything 
 
What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
 
I wear my crown of shit 
On my liar's chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stain of time 
The feeling disappears 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 
 
What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way

 


I CAN'T EXPLAIN

 (Pete Townshend) 
 
New feeling inside 
It's a hot certain kind 
I feel hot and cold 
Down in my soul, baby 
 
I can't explain 
Going out of my mind 
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue 
Things you say well maybe they're true 
I get funny dreams again and again 
Knows what it means, but 
 
Can't explain 
I think it's love 
Say it to you 
When I feel blue 
 
I can't explain, no, I can't explain 
 
You know I can't explain 
I'm going out of my mind 
Well I'm a worried guy 
But I can't explain 


 


I CAN'T READ

 (D.Bowie/R.Gabrels) 
 
I can't read and I can't write down 
I don't know a book from countdown 
I don't care which shadow gets me 
All I've got is someone's face 
 
Money goes to money heaven 
Bodies go to body hell 
I just cough, 
catch the chase 
Switch the channel 
watch the police car 
 
CHORUS 
I can't read shit anymore 
I just sit back and ignore 
I just can't get it right, 
can't get it right 
I can't read shit 
I can't read shit 
 
When you see a famous smile 
No matter where you run your mile 
To be right in that photograph 
Andy where's my fifteen minutes 


 


I FEEL FREE

 (Bruce/Brown) 
 
Dear when I dance with you 
We move like the sea 
You, you're all I want to know 
I feel free 
I feel free 
 
CHORUS (2 times) 
I can walk down the street 
there's no one there 
the pavement is one huge crowd 
I can drive down the road 
my eyes can't see 
but my mind wants to cry out loud 
 
I feel free 
 
Dance floor is like the sea 
The ceiling is the sky 
You're the sun, and as you shine on me 
I feel free (3 times) 


 


I HAVE NOT BEEN TO OXFORD TOWN

 (Music: Bowie/Eno Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Baby Grace is the victim 
She was 14 years of age 
And the wheels are turning, turning 
For the finger points at me 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
All's well 
No I have not been to Oxford Town 
 
CHORUS 
Toll the bell 
Pay the private eye 
All's well 
20th century dies 
 
And the prison priests are decent 
My attorney seems sincere 
I fear my days are numbered 
Lord get me out of here 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
 
CHORUS 
This is your shadow on my wall 
This is my flesh and blood 
This is what I could've been 
 
And the wheels are turning and turning 
As the 20th century dies 
 
If I had not ripped the fabric 
If time had not stood still 
If I had not met Ramona 
If I'd only paid my bill 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
 
CHORUS 
This is my bunk with two sheets 
This is my food though foul 
This is what I could have been 
 
CHORUS (ad lib.) 


 


I KEEP FORGETTING

 (Leiber/Stoller) 
 
I keep forgetting 
you don't love me no more 
I keep forgetting 
you don't want me no more 
I keep forgetting 
that you told me that you 
Didn't want me around any more 
But these stupid old feet 
Just head for your street 
Like they've done so many times before 
And this stubborn old fist 
On the end of my wrist 
Keeps a knocking on your front door 
 
I keep forgetting 
you don't love me no more 
I keep forgetting 
you don't want me no more 
I keep forgetting 
bout those heartbreaking nights 
 
And those heartbreaking things 
That you said 
Though I know in my heart 
We're drifting apart 
I can't believe 
that our love is dead 
 
Though it's plain as can be 
That you're finished with me 
I just can't get it through my head 


 


I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

 (Morrissey) 
 
My love wherever you are 
Whatever you are, don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday to you 
Please wait 
Please wait 
Wait, don't lose faith 
You say that the day never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
But I know it's gonna happen someday to you 
 
Please wait 
Please wait 
Wait, don't lose faith 
Please wait 
Please wait 
Please, don't lose faith 
Don't lose faith 
 
You say that the day never arrives 
And it seems so far away 
But I know it's gonna happen someday 
Someday to you 
To you 
Please wait 


 


I WISH YOU WOULD

 (Billy Arnold) 
 
Early in the morning by the break of day 
That's when my baby went away 
Come back baby I wish you would 
This crying and grieving 
won't do me no good 
 
Hugging and a kissing, late at night 
You know pretty baby it feels just right 
Come back baby what you're trying to do? 
Turning on me and some other men too 
 
Come back baby give me one more chance 
You know I still love 
you gonna give you romance 
Yeah, romance all night long 
In my arms, oh yeah 
 
CHORUS 
 
Hey pretty baby I love you so 
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go 
Oh yeah (repeat ad inf.) 


 


I WOULD BE YOUR SLAVE

 () 
 
Walking in the snowy street 
Let me understand 
Drifting down a silent park 
Stumbling over land 
Open up your heart to me 
Show me who you are 
And I would be your slave 
 
Do you sleep in quietude? 
Do you walk in peace? 
Do you laugh out loud at me? 
No one else that is free 
Open up your heart to me 
Show me all you are 
And I would be your slave 
 
I don't sit around and wait 
I don't give a damn 
I don't see the point at all 
No footprints in the sand 
 
I bet you laugh out loud at me 
A chance to strike me down 
Give me peace of mind at last 
Show me all you are 
Open up your heart to me 
And I would be your slave 
 
I don't sit and wait 
I don't give a damn 
I don't see the point at all 
No footprints in the sand 
I would give you all my love 
Nothing else is free 
Open up your heart to me 
And I would be your slave

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

 (Nei Young) 
 
(I've been looking, I've been looking) 
(I've been looking, I've been looking) 
I've been looking 
For a woman 
To save my life 
Not to beg or to borrow 
A woman with a feeling 
of loosing once or twice 
Who knows how it could be 
Be tomorrow 
 
I've been waiting for you 
And you've been coming to me 
For such a long time now 
For such a long time now 
A woman with a feeling 
Of loosing once or twice 
Who knows how it could be 
Be tomorrow 
 
I've been waiting for you 
And you've been coming to me 
For such a long time now 
For such a long time now 
For such a long time now 
For such a long time now

 


IF I'M DREAMING MY LIFE

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Was she never there? 
Was she ever? 
Was it air she breathed? 
At the wrong time 
 
All the flowers so 
From the gallery 
with the hymns of night 
Singing come to me 
At the wrong time 
On the wrong day 
All the lights are fading now 
If I'm dreaming all my life 
 
Just one living chance 
When the mother sighs 
When the father steps aside 
At the wrong time 
 
Was she never here? 
Was she ever? 
Was it air she breathed? 
At the wrong time 
On the wrong day 
All the lights are fading now 
If I'm dreaming all my life 
If I'm dreaming all my life away 
Dreaming my life 
Dreaming my (x3) 
Dreaming my life 
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho) 
 
Repeat 


 


IF THERE IS SOMETHING

 (Ferry) 
 
If there is something 
That I might find 
Look around corners 
Try to find peace of mind, 
I say 
 Where would you go 
If you were me? 
Trying to keep a straight course 
is not easy 
 
Somebody special 
Looking at me 
Same kind of reaction 
Wanted to cry with me 
If there are many 
Too easy to say 
When it's love 
It's just a game ame ame ame 
 
I would do anything for you 
I would come all day 
I would swim all the oceans blue 
I would walk a thousand miles 
Reveal my secrets 
More than enough for me to share 
I will put roses around your door 
Sit in the garden 
Growing potatoes by the score 
 
Shake your head girl, 
with your ponytail 
Takes me right back 
[when you were young] 
Throw your precious gifts into the air 
Watch them fall down 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
It used to fall apart 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The hills were higher 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The trees were taller then 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The grass was greener 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
It used to fall apart 
[when you were young] 


 


IT AIN T EASY

 (Ron Davies) 
 
When you climb to the top of the mountain 
Look out over the sea 
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be 
Then you jump back down to the rooftops 
Look out over the town 
Think about all of the strange things circulating round 
 
 
 
CHORUS 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy 
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down 
 
Well all the people have got their problems 
That ain't nothing new 
With the help of the good Lord 
We can all pull on through 
We can all pull on through 
Get there in the end 
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again 
 
CHORUS 
 
Satisfaction, satisfaction 
Keep me satisfied 
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman 
She calling from inside 
She's a calling from inside 
Trying to get to you 
All the woman really wants you can give her something 
too 
 
CHORUS (x2)

You throw a rock against the road 
And it breaks into pieces 
Draw the blinds on yesterday, 
and it's all so much scarier 
Put a bullet in my brain, 
and it makes all the papers 2 
 
Nammin no kiroku eiga 
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi 
Michi ni ishi o nage reba 
Kona gona ni kudake 
Kino ni huta o sureba 
Kyohu wa masu 
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba 
Shinbun wa kaki tateru 
 
So where's the moral 
when people have their fingers broken2 
To be insulted by these fascists 
it's so degrading 
And it's no game 
 
Shut up! Shutu 


 


IT'S NO GAME (PART 2)

 
 
Silhouettes and shadows 
watch the revolution 
No more free steps to heaven 
Just walkie talkie heaven or hearth 
Just big heads and drums full speed and pagan 
And it's no game 
 
I am barred from the event 
I really don't understand the situation 
So where's the moral 
People have their fingers broken 
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading 
And it's no game 
 
Documentaries on refugees, 
couples 'gainst the target 
Throw a rock against the road, 
and it breaks into pieces 
Draw the blinds on yesterday, 
and it's all so much scarier 
Put a bullet in my brain, 
and it makes all the papers 
 
And it's no game 
 
Children round the world, 
put camel shit on the walls 
 
They're making carpets on treadmills, 
or garbage sorting 
 
And it's no game 


 


JANINE

 
 
Oh my love, Janine 
I'm helpless for your smile 
Like a Polish wanderer 
I travel ever onwards to your land 
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand 
 
Your strange demand 
To 'collocate' my mind 
Scares me into gloom 
You're too intense 
I'll have to keep you in your place 
I've no defence 
I've got to keep my veil on my face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well 
But I've got things inside my head 
That even I can't face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls 
But if you take an axe to me 
You'll kill another man 
Not me at all 
 
You're fey, Janine 
A tripper to the last 
But if I catch you standing on my toes 
I'll have a right to shout you down 
For you're a lazy stream 
In which my thoughts would drown 
 
So stay, Janine 
And we can glide along 
I've caught your wings for laughs 
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year 
So take your glasses off 
And don't act so sincere 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well 
But I've got things inside my head 
That even I can't face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls 
But if you take an axe to me 
You'll kill another man 
Not me at all 


 


JOHN, I'M ONLY DANCING

 Well, Annie's pretty neat, 
she always eats her meat 
Joe is awful strong, 
bet your life he's putting us on 
Oh lordy, oh lordy, 
you know I need some loving 
I'm moving, touch me! 
 
(CHORUS) 
John, I'm only dancing 
She turns me on, 
but I'm only dancing 
She turns me on, 
don't get me wrong 
I'm only dancing 
 
Oh shadow love was quick and clean, 
life's a well thumbed machine 
I saw you watching from the stairs, 
you're everyone that ever cared 
Oh lordy, oh lordy, 
you know I need some loving 
I'm moving, touch me! 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
Dancing, 
won't someone dance with me? 
Touch me! Ohhh!

 


JOIN THE GANG

 
 
Let me introduce you to the gang 
Johnny plays the sitar, he s an existentialist 
Once he had a name, now he plays our game 
You won t feel so good now that you ve joined the gang 
Molly is the model in the ads 
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip 
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong 
Cause she can t switch off, now that she s joined the gang 
Arthur is a singer with a band 
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage 
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid 
They want to see the croaking man who joined the band 
You won t be alone, we ve all got beery grins 
It s a big illusion but at least you re in 
At least you re in 
This club s called The Webb, it s this month s pick 
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren t so stiff 
15 bob a coke, fraid that s past a joke 
This is how to spend now that you ve joined a gang 
This is what to do now that you re here 
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast 
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars 
They re picking up the joints now that they ve joined the gang 


 


JUMP (THEY SAY)

 
 
When comes the shaking man 
A nation in his eyes 
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo 
Streaking cathedral spire 
 
 
They say 
he has no brain 
They say 
he has no mood 
They say 
he was born again 
They say 
look at him climb 
They say 'Jump' 
 
They say 
he has two gods 
They say 
he has no fear 
They say 
he has no eyes 
They say 
he has no mouth 
 
They say hey that's really something 
They feel he should get some time 
I say he should watch his ass 
My friend don't listen to the crowd 
They say 'Jump' 
Got to believe somebody 
Got to believe 


 


KINGDOM COME

 (Verlaine) 
 
 
Well I walked in the pouring rain 
And I heard a voice that cries 
 It's all in vain 
The voice of doom 
was shining in my room 
I just need one day 
somewhere far away 
Lord I just need one day 
 
Well I'll be breaking these rocks 
And cutting this hay 
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks 
What's my price to pay? 
 
Well the river's so muddy, 
but it may come clear 
And I know too well what's keeping me here 
I'm just the slave of a burning ray 
Oh give me the night, 
I can't take another sight 
Please, please give me the night 
 
CHORUS 
 
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high 
 
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die 
 
I won't be breaking no rocks 
I said I won't be breaking no rocks 
 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
When the kingdom comes 


 


KOOKS

 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
'Cause we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow so take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks 
Hung up on romancing 
 
We bought a lot of things 
to keep you warm and dry 
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry 
I bought you a pair of shoes 
A trumpet you can blow 
And a book of rules 
On what to say to people 
when they pick on you 
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too 
 
CHORUS 
 
And if you ever have to go to school 
Remember how they messed up 
this old fool 
Don't pick fights with the bullies 
or the cads 
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads 
And if the homework brings you down 
Then we'll throw it on the fire 
And take the car downtown 
 
CHORUS (repeat ad inf.) 


 


LADY GRINNING SOUL

 
 
She'll come, she'll go. 
She'll lay belief on you 
Skin sweet with musky oil 
The lady from another grinning soul 
 
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard 
She'll drive a beetle car 
And beat you down at cool Canasta 
 
And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room 
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress 
She will be your living end 
 
She'll come, she'll go. 
She'll lay belief on you 
But she won't stake her life on you 
How can life become 
her point of view 
 
And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room 
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress 
She will be your living end (repeat) 


 


LADY STARDUST

 
 
People stared at the makeup on his face 
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace 
 
The boy in the bright blue jeans 
Jumped up on the stage 
And lady stardust sang his songs 
Of darkness and disgrace 
 
 
CHORUS 
And he was alright, the band was altogether 
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever 
And he was awful nice 
Really quite out of sight 
(second time: really quite paradise) 
And he sang all night long 
 
Femme fatales emerged from shadows 
To watch this creature fair 
Boys stood upon their chairs 
To make their point of view 
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey 
 
Lady Stardust sang his songs 
Of darkness and dismay 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh how I sighed 
When they asked if I knew his name 
 
CHORUS 
 
Get some pussy now! 


 


LAW (EARTHLING ON FIRE)

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels Lyrics Bowie) 
 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
 
In the street a man shouts out loud 
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun 
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Oh I get a little bit afraid 
Sometimes 
 
Earthlings on fire 
 
CHORUS 
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Sure I get a little bit afraid 
Sometimes 
 
Earthlings on fire 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
 
In a house a man drops dead 
As he hits the floor he sighs 
 What a morning 
 
CHORUS 
Sometimes 
Earthlings on fire 
Oh I get a little bit afraid 
 
Sometimes 
 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
 
Oh I get a little bit afraid 
Sometimes 
 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge

LET'S DANCE

 
 
Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues 
 
Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio 
 
Let's sway 
while color lights up your face 
Let's sway 
sway through the crowd to an empty space 
 
 
If you say run, I'll run with you 
If you say hide, we'll hide 
Because my love for you 
Would break my heart in two 
If you should fall 
Into my arms 
And tremble like a flower 
 
Let's dance for fear 
your grace should fall 
Let's dance for fear tonight is all 
 
Let's sway you could look into my eyes 
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight 
 
If you say run, I'll run with you 
If you say hide, we'll hide 
Because my love for you 
Would break my heart in two 
If you should fall 
Into my arms 
And tremble like a flower 
 
Let's dance put on your red shoes 
and dance the blues 
 
Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio 
 
Let's sway you could look into my eyes 
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight 


 


LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER

 (Jagger/Richards) 
 
 
Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind 
I'm in no hurry 
I can take my time 
I'm going red 
and my tongue's getting tired 
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry 
I'm h h h high 
 
CHORUS 
Let's spend the night together 
Now I need you more than ever 
Let's spend the night together now 
 
I feel so strong 
that I can't disguise, oh my 
Well, I just can't apologise, no 
Don't hang me up but don't let me down 
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around 
and around 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh, You know I'm smiling baby 
You need some guiding baby 
I'm just deciding baby 
 
CHORUS 
 
This doesn't happen to me every day 
No excuses I've got anyway, heh 
I'll satisfy your every need 
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my my my my my 
 
Let's spend the night together 
Now I need you more than ever (x3) 
 
Let's spend the night together 
They said we were too young 
Our kind of love 
was no fun 
But our love 
comes from above 
Do it! 
Let's make love 
Hoo! 
 
CHORUS 


 


LETTER TO HERMIONE

 
 
The hand that wrote this letter 
Sweeps the pillow clean 
So rest your head and 
read a treasured dream 
I care for no one else but you 
I tear my soul to cease the pain 
I think maybe you feel the same 
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do 
So I've been writing just for you 
 
They say your life is going very well 
They say you sparkle like a different girl 
But something tells me that you hide 
When all the world is warm and tired 
You cry a little in the dark 
Well so do I 
I'm not quite sure 
what you're supposed to say 
But I can see it's not okay 
 
He makes you laugh 
He brings you out in style 
He treats you well 
And makes you up real fine 
And when he's strong 
He's strong for you 
And when you kiss 
It's something new 
But did you ever call my name 
Just by mistake? 
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do 
So I'll just write some love to you 


 


LIFE ON MARS

 
 
It's a god awful small affair 
To the girl with the mousy hair 
But her mummy is yelling No 
And her daddy has told her to go 
But her friend is nowhere to be seen 
Now she walks 
through her sunken dream 
To the seat with the clearest view 
And she's hooked to the silver screen 
But the film is a saddening bore 
For she's lived it 
ten times or more 
She could spit in the eyes of fools 
As they ask her to focus on 
 
CHORUS 
Sailors fighting in the dance hall 
Oh man! 
Look at those cavemen go 
It's the freakiest show 
Take a look at the Lawman 
Beating up the wrong guy 
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know 
He's in the best selling show 
Is there life on Mars? 
 
It's on Amerika's tortured brow 
That Mickey Mouse 
has grown up a cow 
Now the workers 
have struck for fame 
'Cause Lennon's on sale again 
See the mice in their million hordes 
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads 
Rule Britannia is out of bounds 
To my mother, my dog, and clowns 
But the film is a saddening bore 
'Cause I wrote it 
ten times or more 
It's about to be writ again 
As I ask you to focus on 
 
CHORUS 
Dring dring dring...... 
(Mind the phone) 


 


LITTLE WONDER

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels/Plati Lyrics Bowie) 
 
Stinky weather, Fat shaky hands 
Dopey morning Doc, 
Grumpy gnomes 
Little wonder then, little wonder 
You little wonder, 
little wonder you 
Big screen dolls, 
tits and explosions 
Sleepytime, Bashful but nude 
Little wonder then, little wonder 
You little wonder, 
little wonder you 
I'm getting it 
 
Intergalactic, see me to be you 
It's all in the tablets, 
Sneezy Bhutan 
Little wonder then, little wonder 
You little wonder, 
little wonder you 
Mars happy nation, 
sit on my karma 
Dame meditation, take me away 
Little wonder then, 
little wonder 
You little wonder, 
little wonder you 
 
CHORUS 
Sending me so far away, so far away 
So far away, so far away 
So far away, so so far away 
So far away, so far away 
So far away, so so far away 
 
Little wonder 
You little wonder, you 
Little wonder 
You little wonder you 


 


LOOK BACK IN ANGER

 (Lyrics by Bowie 
Music by Bowie/Eno) 
 
 You know who I am, he said 
The speaker was an angel 
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings 
Closed his eyes and moved his lips 
 It's time we should be going 
 
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night 
Till you come 
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
Look back in anger, 
see it in my eyes 
Till you come 
 
No one seemed to hear him 
So he leafed through a magazine 
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away 
Very sane he seemed to me 
 
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night 
Till you come 
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
Look back in anger, 
feel it in my voice 
Till you come 
 
(Waiting so long, ahhh...) 
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
(repeat ad inf.)

LOOKING FOR SATELLITES

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels/Plati Lyrics Bowie) 
 
REFRAIN 
Nowhere 
Shampoo 
TV 
Come back 
Boy's own 
Slim tie 
Showdown 
Can't stop 
 
Where do we go from here? 
There's something in the sky 
Shining in the light 
Spinning and far away 
 
CHORUS 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Looking for satellites 
Looking for satellites 
 
Where do we go to now? 
There's nothing in our eyes 
As lonely as a moon 
Misty and far away 
 
CHORUS 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Satellite 
Looking satellites 
Looking satellites 
 
Where do we go from here? 


 


LOOKING FOR WATER

 Silver leaves are spinning round 
Take my hand as we go down and down and down 
Looking for water 
But I lost God in a New York minute 
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it 
(Looking looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
I'm looking for water 
(Looking looking looking) 
I can't breathe the air 
Can't raise the fight 
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night 
And I'm 
Looking for water 
Looking for water 
Looking for water 
Looking looking 
 
Take my hand as we go down and down 
Leave it all behind nothing will be found 
I'm looking for water 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking everywhere 
Looking for water 
Looking here and there 
I'm looking for water 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
 
I can't live in this cage 
I can't eat this candy 
To the ends of the Earth 
To this pain in my head 
The look in your eyes 
That never means never 
The dawns early light 
Baby dumb is forever 
 
(Looking looking) 
(Looking looking) 
 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water 
(Looking looking) 
I'm looking for water 
Looking for water

 


LOVE YOU TILL TUESDAY

 
 
Just look through your window, look who sits outside 
Little me is waiting, standing through the night 
When you ll walk through your door I ll wave my flag and shout 
 
Oh, beautiful baby 
My burning desire started on Sunday 
Give me your heart and I ll love you till Tuesday 
Da da da dum (x4) 
 
 
Who s that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch 
 
Don t be afraid it s only me, hoping for a little romance 
 
If you lie beneath my shade, I ll keep you nice and cool 
 
Oh, beatiful baby 
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday 
My passion s never ending and I ll love you till Tuesday 
Da da da dum (x7) 
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea 
Don t be afraid of the man in the moon, because it s only me 
 
 
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry 
 
 
Oh, beautiful baby 
My heart s a flame, I ll love you till Tuesday 
My head s in a whirl and I ll love you till Tuesday 
 
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday (x2) 
Da da da dum (x11) 
 
 
Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday 


 


LOVING THE ALIEN

 
 
Watching them come and go 
The Templars and the Saracens 
They're travelling the holy land 
Opening telegrams 
 
Torture comes and torture goes 
Knights who'd give you anything 
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon 
Salvation for the mirror blind 
 
But if you pray 
all your sins are hooked upon the sky 
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear 
Prayers they hide 
the saddest view 
(Believing the strangest things, 
loving the alien) 
 
And your prayers they break the sky in two 
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien) 
 
You pray til the break of dawn 
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien) 
 
And you'll believe you're loving the alien 
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien) 
 
Thinking of a different time 
Palestine a modern problem 
Bounty and your wealth in land 
Terror in a best laid plan 
 
Watching them come and go 
Tomorrows and the yesterdays 
Christians and the unbelievers 
Hanging by the cross and nail 


 


LUCY CAN'T DANCE

 
 
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do 
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too 
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways 
I say trust Him at once which is something these days 
 
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do (x2) 
 
Did the world just explode? 
Don't recognize anyone 
But you've still got me under your thumb 
 
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise 
can do 
 
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy 
In this sexual noise, vicious chords 
offer joy 
You live and you die in the blink of an eye 
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise 
 
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do 
(x2) 
Dance to the noise 
 
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do 
But you can't buy me off in this serial world 
Who who who died and made you material girl? 
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do 
 
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric 
goes wrong 
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern 
song 
Lucy can't dance to the noise but 
she knows what the noise 
can do 
 
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality 
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need 
you 
Live and you die in the blink of an eye 
Still I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise 
 
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Slap that slap that baby make him free 
Dance, magic dance 
(dance, magic dance) (repeat ad lib) 


 


MAID OF BOND STREET

 
 
This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the picture of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of bond street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don t smile at her, don t smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy she once knew 
Doesn t want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Everything she wants is hers 
But she can t make it with the boy she really wants to be 
with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn t have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
 
And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn t have worldly cares 
 
Maids of Bond street shouldn t have love affairs 


 


MEMORY OF A FREE FESTIVAL

 
 
The Children of the summer's end 
Gathered in the dampened grass 
We played Our songs and felt the London sky 
Resting on our hands 
It was God's land 
It was ragged and naive 
It was Heaven 
 
Touch, We touched the very soul 
Of holding each and every life 
We claimed the very source of joy ran through 
It didn't, but it seemed that way 
I kissed a lot of people that day 
 
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon 
To paint that love 
upon a white balloon 
And fly it from 
the topest top of all the tops 
That man has pushed beyond his brain 
Satori must be something 
just the same 
 
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size 
We talked with tall Venusians passing through 
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head 
And away they soared 
Climbing through 
the ivory vibrant cloud 
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd 
And We walked back to the road, 
unchained 
 
 The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party 
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party 
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party 
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party 
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party. 


 


MIRACLE GOODNIGHT

 
 
Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives 
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight 
Future full and empty knocking on my door 
Ragged limbed and hungry mama 
Miracle no more 
 
(Skin tell me) turn it around 
(Head tell me) make it alright 
(Nobody dancing) 
 
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high 
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight 
Evening flower all alone, pazanane capeche 
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more 
 
CHORUS 
(Skin tell me) turn it around 
(Head tell me) make it all right 
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight 
(Breath tell me) turn it around 
(Heart tell me) make it all right 
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe 
 
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here 
I wished I had a future, anywhere 
 
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams 
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin 
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore 
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight 
 
 
CHORUS 
 
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal 
I really don't want to know that 
The less we know, the better we feel 
 
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high 
Spinning around my little room, miracle 
 
CHORUS 
(Skin tell me) turn it around 
(Moon tell me) make it alright 
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe 
(Eyes tell me) turn it around 
(News tell me) make it alright 
(Nobody dancing) 
 
CHORUS 


 


MODERN LOVE

 
 
I know when to go out 
And when to stay in 
Get things done (spoken) 
 
I catch a paper boy 
But things don't really change 
I'm standing in the wind 
But I never wave bye bye 
 
But I try 
I try 
 
There's no sign of life 
It's just the power to charm 
I'm lying in the rain 
But I never wave bye bye 
 
But I try 
I try 
 
Never gonna fall for 
Modern Love walks beside me 
Modern Love walks on by 
Modern Love gets me to the Church on Time 
Church on Time terrifies me 
Church on Time makes me party 
Church on Time puts my trust in God and Man 
God and Man no confessions 
God and Man no religion 
God and Man don't believe 
in Modern Love 


 


MOONAGE DAYDREAM

 
 
 
 
I'm an alligator, I'm a mama papa coming for you 
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you 
Keep your mouth shut, 
you're squawking like a pink monkey bird 
And I'm busting up my brains for the words 
 
 
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe 
Put your ray gun to my head 
Press your space face close to mine, love 
 
 
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah! 
 
 
 
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me 
The church of man, love 
Is such a holy place to be 
Make me baby, make me know you really care 
 
Make me jump into the air 
 
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe 
Put your ray gun to my head 
Press your space face close to mine, love 
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah! 
 
 
 
Freak out, far out, in out

 


MOVE ON

 
 
Sometimes I feel 
That I need to move on 
So I pack a bag 
And move on 
Move on 
 
Well I might take a train 
Or sail at dawn 
Might take a girl 
When I move on 
When I move on 
 
Somewhere, someone's calling me 
When the chips are down 
I'm just a travelling man 
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but 
Somewhere there's a morning sky 
Bluer than her eyes 
Somewhere there's an ocean 
Innocent and wild 
 
Africa is sleepy people 
Russia has its horsemen 
Spent some nights in old Kyoto 
Sleeping on the matted ground 
Cyprus is my island 
When the going's rough 
I would love to find you 
Somewhere in a place like that 
 
Somewhere, someone's calling me 
When the chips are down 
I stumble like a blind man 
Can't forget you 
Can't forget you 
 
Feeling like a shadow 
Drifting like a leaf 
I stumble like a blind man 
Can't forget you 
Can't forget you 
 
Can't forget you 
Can't forget you

MY DEATH

 My death waits 
like an old rou� 
So confident I'll go his way 
Whistle to him and the passing time 
My death waits 
like a bible truth 
At the funeral of my youth 
Weep loud for that 
and the passing time 
My death waits 
like a witch at night 
As surely as our love is bright 
Let's not think about the passing time 
 
CHORUS 
But what ever lies behind the door 
There is nothing much to do 
Angel or devil, I don't care 
For in front of that door, there is you 
My death waits 
like a beggar blind 
Who sees the world 
through an unlit mind 
Throw him a dime 
for the passing time 
My death waits there 
between your thighs 
Your cool fingers 
will close my eyes 
Let's not think of that 
and the passing time 
My death waits 
to allow my friends 
A few good times before it ends 
So let's drink to that 
and the passing time 
 
CHORUS 
My death waits there among the leaves 
In magicians' mysterious sleeves 
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time 
My death waits there among the flowers 
Where the blackest shadow, 
blackest shadow cowers 
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time 
My death waits there 
in a double bed 
Sails of oblivion at my head 
So pull up the sheets 
against the passing time 
 
CHORUS

 


NATHAN ADLER

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Old Touchschriek was 
the main nameserver 
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer 
But he didn't know from shit 
About challenge response systems 
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling 
interest drugs 
She got males all hung up 
on her mind filters 
She was if you don't mind me saying so an update demon 
Now Leon 
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight 
He jumps up on the stage 
With a criss criss machete 
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything 
I mean a zero 
in the fabric of time itself 
Was this a suspect? 
I says to myself 
Woa! Quelle courage! 
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself 
Let me take you back to 
when it all began 


 


NATURE BOY

 There was a boy, 
a very strange 
enchanted boy 
they say he wandered 
very far, very far 
over land and sea, 
a little shy and 
sad of eye, 
but very wise was he 
and then one day, a magic day, 
he passed my way 
and while he spoke 
of many things, 
fools and kings, 
this he said to me, 
 The greatest thing 
you'll ever learn 
is just to love 
and be loved 

 


NEIGHBOROUGH THREAT

 (Musica Bowie/Gardner Lyrics Pop) 
 
Down where your paint is cracking 
Look down your backstairs buddy 
Somebody's living there and 
He don't really feel the weather 
And he don't share your pleasures 
No he don't share your pleasures 
Look at his eyes 
Did you see his crazy eyes 
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash 
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash 
 
You can't help him 
Nobody can 
Now that he knows 
There's nothing to get 
Will you still place your bet 
On the neighbourhood threat 
 
Somewhere a baby's bleeding 
Somewhere a mother's needing 
Outside a boy is lying 
But mostly he is crying 
And he just shouts in anger 
You'll find him interesting 
Look at his eyes 
Did you see his crazy eyes 
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you 
Everybody always wants to run with you 


 


NEVER GET OLD

 Better take care 
Think I better go, better get a room 
Better take care of me 
Again and again 
 
I think about this and I think about personal history 
Better take care 
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real 
When the star turns round 
Again and again 
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown 3 2 1 
Forever 
 
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time 
Forever 
The sky splits open to a dull red skull 
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now 
 
And there's never gonna be enough money 
And there's never gonna be enough drugs 
And I'm never ever gonna get old 
There's never gonna be enough bullets 
There's never gonna be enough sex 
And I'm never ever gonna get old 
So I'm never ever gonna get high 
And I'm never ever gonna get low 
And I'm never ever gonna get old 
 
Better take care 
 
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you 
Again and again 
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you 
Better take care 
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you 
Again and again 
 
Wanna be here and I wanna be there 
Living just like you, living just like me 
Forever 
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland 
Forever 
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air 
 
And I'm running down the street of life 
And I'm never gonna let you die 
And I'm never ever gonna get old 
And I'm never ever gonna get 
I'm never ever gonna get 
I'm never ever gonna get old 
And I'm never ever gonna get 
And I'm never ever gonna get 
Never ever gonna get old

 


NEVER LET ME DOWN

 (Bowie/Alomar) 
 
When I believed in nothing 
I called her name 
Trapped in a high dollar joint 
in some place 
I called her name 
And though my days are slipping by 
And nights so cruel 
I thought I'd die 
She danced her little dance 
'till it made me cry 
She was shakin' like this honey doing that 
 
When I needed soul revival 
I called your name 
When I was falling to pieces 
I screamed in pain 
 
Your soothing hand that turned me round 
A love so real 
swept over me 
You danced your little dance 
'till it made me cry 
You were shakin' like this honey doing that 
 
Never let me down She never let me down 
Never let me down She never let me down 
 
When all your faith is failing Call my name 
When you've got nothing coming Call my name 
 
I'll be strong for all it takes 
I'll cover your head 
till the bad stuff breaks 
I'll dance my little dance 
till it makes you smile 
Shaking like this honey doing that 
 
Never let you down I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down 


 


NEW ANGELS OF PROMISE

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
New Angels of Promise 
We despair 
We are the dead dreams 
We take the blame 
Take us to the edge of time 
Take us to the edge of time 
We are the fabulous lovers 
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes 
 
 
CHORUS 
Suspicious minds 
You didn't feel us coming 
In this lonely crowd, it's always time 
(x2) 
 
 
New Angels of Promise 
we despise 
Don't fall apart now 
We are the silent ones 
Take us to the edge of time 
Take us to the edge of time 
We are the tabular lovers 
We listen to the storm 
 
CHORUS 


 


NEW KILLER STAR

 See the great white scar 
Over Battery Park 
Then a flare glides over 
But I won't look at that scar 
Oh, my nuclear baby 
Oh, my idiot trance 
All my idiot questions 
Let's face the music and dance 
 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready 
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready 
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you 
 
All the corners of the buildings 
Who but we remember these? 
The sidewalks and trees 
I'm thinking now 
I got a better way 
I discovered a star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
A new killer star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
The stars in your eyes 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
I discovered a star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
 
See my life in a comic 
Like the way they did the Bible 
With the bubbles and action 
The little details in colour 
First a horseback bomber 
Just a small thin chance 
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline 
Let's face the music and dance 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready 
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready 
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you 
 
All the corners of the buildings 
Who but we remember these? 
The sidewalks and trees 
I'm thinking now 
I got a better way 
I discovered a star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
A new killer star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
The stars in your eyes 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
I discovered a star 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go 
I got a better way 
Oooh oo 
I got a better way 
Ready, set, go

 


NEW YORK'S IN LOVE

 
 
Do you see that thing 
I'm sure it's love 
Would you do one thing 
New York's in love 
The city grew wings 
in the back of the night 
The clouds are stuck 
like candy floss 
She sees the rich trash 
having all the fun 
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from 
 
There's nothing you can do to her 
This city's all clean and waiting 
I don't mean to wait too long 
But this joint can't get much higher 
 
 
CHORUS 
New York's in love 
With her big green eyes 
And her long blonde hair 
New York's in flames 
New York's in love 
With the way she talks 
And the way she walks 
New York's in love 
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo 
 
My, oh my, it's a tom tom beat 
No one knows they've had their day 
We can dance and we can see the singles swing 
Everybody's waiting for the Go Go Boys. 
You're turned to stone by the family 
It's now the dead speak to the living 
Nothing left here 
but a raging blaze 
I don't mean to wait too long 
 
CHORUS 


 


NITE FLIGHTS

 (Engels) 
 
There's no hold 
The moving has come through 
The danger passing you 
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels 
It's so cold 
The dark dug up by dogs 
The stiches torn and broke 
The raw meat fist you choke 
Has hit the bloodlite 
 
Glass traps open and close on 
nite flights 
Broken necks feather weights press the walls 
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights 
With only one promise, only one way to fall 
 
 
Glass traps open and close on nite flights 
Broken necks feather weights press the walls 
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights 
With only one promise, only one way to call 
 
 
On nite flights 
Only one way to fall 


 


NO CONTROL

 (Music: Bowie/Eno Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Stay away from the future 
Back away from the light 
It's all deranged no control 
Sit tight in your corner 
Don't tell God your plans 
It's all deranged 
No control 
 
If I could control tomorrow's haze 
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me 
If I can't control 
the web we weave 
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves 
 
Every single move's uncertain 
Don't tell God your plans 
It's all deranged 
No control 
 
I should live my life on bended knee 
If I can't control my destiny 
You've gotta have a scheme 
You've gotta have a plan 
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man 
 
No control 
Stay away from the future 
Don't tell God your plans 
It's all deranged 
No control 
 
Forbidden words, deafen me 
In memory, no control 
See how far a sinful man 
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes 
 
 
You've gotta have a scheme 
You've gotta have a plan 
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man 
I should live my life on bended knee 
If I can't control my destiny 
No control I can't believe 
I've no control 
It's all deranged 
 
I can't believe I've no control 
It's all deranged 
Deranged 
Deranged 


 


OH! YOU PRETTY THINGS

 
 
Wake up you sleepy head 
Put on some clothes, 
shake up your bed 
Put another log on the fire for me 
I've made some breakfast and coffee 
Look out my window and what do I see 
A crack in the sky 
and a hand reaching down to me 
All the nightmares came today 
And it looks as though they're 
here to stay 
What are we coming to 
No room for me, 
no fun for you 
I think about a world to come 
Where the books were found 
by the Golden ones 
Written in pain, written in awe 
By a puzzled man who questioned 
What we were here for 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though 
they're here to stay 
 
CHORUS: 
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Let me make it plain 
(second time: Let me say it again) 
You gotta make way 
for the Homo Superior 
 
Look at your children 
See their faces in golden rays 
Don't kid yourself they belong to you 
They're the start of a coming race 
The earth is a bitch 
We've finished our news 
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though they're here to stay 
 
CHORUS 


 


ONE SHOT

 (Bowie/Gabrels/H. Sales/T. Sales) 
 
Ooo oo oo oh, oo oo oo oh 
Ooo oo oo oh, oo oo ooo 
 
The last days were the meanest 
Leanest days of our lives 
You threw me the pieces 
I started the fire 
One thing led to a dead end 
One shot put her away, hey hey 
 
Look out on a green world 
Windows and wives 
No bedroom to run to 
No miracle jive 
no conversation 
Then nothing meant nothing 
Ten dollars tore us apart 
One thing led to a dead end 
One shot put her away 
 
One day nothing meant nothing 
Ten dollars tore us apart 
One thing led to a dead end 
One shot put her away 
 
The last days were the meanest 
Leanest days of our lives 
One thing led to a dead end 
One shot further away 
 
Look out on a green world 
Windows and wives 
No bedroom to run to 
No miracle jive 
no conversation 
Hot love is the dearest 
No money can buy 
She burnt like a spitfire 
One shot put her away 
One shot put her away, heh heh 
One shot put her away, uh huh huh, uh huh huh 
Oo oo oo oh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh 
Oo oo oo oh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh 
Oo oo oo oh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh 
Oo oo oo oh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh 
Oo oo oo oh, uh huh huh 
One shot put her away 


 


OPENING TITLES

 (/Trevor Jones) 
 
It's only forever 
Not long at all 
Lost and lonely 
 
No one can blame you 
For walking away 
Too much rejection 
No love injection 
Life can be easy 
It's not always swell 
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl 
'Cause it hurts like hell 
(echo: hurts like hell) 
 
But down in the underground 
You'll find someone true 
Down in the underground 
A land serene 
A crystal moon, ah ,ah 
 
It's only forever 
It's not long at all 
Lost and lonely 
That's underground 
Underground 


 


OUTSIDE

 (Music: Armstrong/Bowie Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Now. Not tomorrow. 
Yesterday 
Not tomorrow 
 
It happens today 
The damage today 
They fall on today 
They beat on the outside 
And I'll stand by you 
 
Now. Not tomorrow 
It's happening now 
Not tomorrow 
 
It's happening now 
The crazed in the hot zone 
The mental and diva's hands 
The fisting of life 
To the music outside 
To the music outside 
 
It happens outside 
The music is outside 
It's happening outside 
The music is outside 
It's happening now 
Not tomorrow 
Yesterday 
Not tomorrow 
 
The music is outside 
It's happening outside 
The music is outside 
The music is outside 
Outside 
Outside 
Outside 


 


PABLO PICASSO

 Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his finger nails 
 
Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his finger nails 
 
Well some people try to pick up girls 
They get called assholes 
This never happened to Pablo Picasso 
 
The girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado 
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado 
 
He could walk down your street 
Girls could not resist his stare 
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole 
Not like you 
Wow! 
 
Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his finger nails 
 
Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his finger nails 
 
He could walk down your street 
And girls could not resist his stare 
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole 
 
Well the girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado 
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado 
 
Well he was only 5'3 
But girls could not resist his stare 
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole 
Not in New York 
Wow! 
 
Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his finger nails 
 
Swinging on the back porch 
Jumping off a big log 
Pablo's feeling better now 
Hanging by his picture nails

 


PALLAS ATHENA

 
 
God is on top of it all 
That's all 
We are we are we are 


 


PANIC IN DETROIT

 
 
He looked a lot like Che Guevara, 
drove a diesel van 
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, 
such a humble man 
The only survivor of the National People's Gang 
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph 
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone 
 
Panic in Detroit 
 
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening 
gloom 
The police had warned of repercussions 
 
They followed none too soon 
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive 
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph 
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone 
 
Panic in Detroit 
 
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school 
And I found my teacher 
crouching in his overalls 
 
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine 
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights 
 
Having scored a trillion dollars, 
made a run back home 
 
Found him slumped across the table. 
A gun and me alone 
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two 
Panic in Detroit. 
He'd left me an autograph 
 Let me collect dust. 
I wish someone would phone 
 
Panic in Detroit

 


PLEASE MR. GRAVEDIGGER

 
 
There s a little churchyard just along the way 
It used to be Lambeth s finest array 
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz 
Til the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot 
 
And in this little yard, there s a little old man 
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand 
 
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves 
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home 
 Ah choo, excuse me 
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don t feel ashamed 
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed 
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn t care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl s hair 
 
And you put it in your pocket 
 God, it s pouring down 
Her mother doesn t know about your sentimental joy 
She thinks it s down below with the rest of her toys 
And Ma wouldn t understand, so I won t tell 
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket 
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day 
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave 
Mary Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay 
 
And I was the wicked man who took her life away 
Very selfish, oh God 
No, Mr. GD, you won t tell 
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself 
I ve started digging holes myself 
And this one here s for you 
 Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn t know of it 
Hello misses, thought she d be a little girl 
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this 
rain 


 


PRETTY THING

 (D.Bowie) 
 
Think about the good things 
Think about the bad things 
Think about a reason 
to see you tonight 
Something getting hard 
when you rock it up 
Something getting hot 
when you rock it up 
Pretty little girl 
let your sweet thing sway 
Never gonna treat you wrong 
Tie you down pretend you're Madonna 
Never gonna treat you wrong 
 
Oh you pretty thing 
Shake your pretty thng 
Gimme that pretty thing 
 
Think about the love thing 
Think about the sex thing 
Think about you holding me, taking me down 
Something getting hard 
when you rock it up 
Something getting hot 
when you rock it up 
Pretty little girl 
let your sweet thing sway 
Never gonna do you wrong 
Strip you down 
and take you to pieces 
Always gonna love this song 
 
Oh you pretty thing 
Feel that pretty thing 
Suck that pretty thing 


 


PRISONER OF LOVE

 (D.Bowie/T.Sales/H.Sales/R.Gabrels) 
 
Don't look back 
Whatever it takes 
to save your life 
I've believed I belonged to you for a long time 
And my heart says no, no one but you 
Like a rescue on a darkened street 
Love walked into town 
I was a victim of my own self persecution 
I'm a prisoner of love 
but I'm coming up for air 
 
CHORUS 
Now don't be fooled by fools 
who promise you 
The world and all that glitters more fool you 
I'm such a hungry man that I beg you over and over and over and over 
And I might take any highway 
to be there with you 
Even the best men 
shiver in their beds 
I'm loving you above everything I have 
I'm a prisoner of love 
just stay square 
 
Like a sermon on a blues guitar 
Love walked into town 
I was drowning so slowly 
One step in front of your shadow 
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air 
 
CHORUS 
I smell the sickness sown 
in this city 
It drives me to hide you, yea, 
even deceive you 
I'm so afraid for you 
that I'll break any thug 
that maps out your passage to ruin 
Even the best men 
shiver in their beds 
I'm loving you above 
everything I have 
I'm a prisoner of love 
just stay square 


 


QUEEN BITCH

 
 
I'm up on the eleventh floor 
And I'm watching the cruisers below 
My heart's in the basement 
My weekend's 
at an all time low 
He's down on the street 
And he's trying hard 
to pull sister Flo 
 
'Cause she's hoping to score 
So I can't see her 
letting him go 
Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
 
CHORUS 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat 
and bipperty bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 
 
She's an old time ambassador 
Of sweet talking, night walking games 
And she's known in the darkest clubs 
For pushing ahead of the dames 
If she says she can do it 
Then she can do it, 
she don't make false claims 
But she's a Queen, 
and such are queens 
That your laughter 
is sucked in their brains 
Now she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say, 
why didn't I say, no, no, no 
 
CHORUS 
 
So I lay down a while 
And I look at my hotel wall 
Oh the cot is so cold 
It don't feel like no bed at all 
Yeah I lay down a while 
And I look at my hotel wall 
But he's down on the street 
So I throw both his bags down the hall 
And I'm phoning a cab 
'Cause my stomach feels small 
There's a taste in my mouth 
And it's no taste at all 
 
It could have been me 
Oh yeah, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say, 
Why didn't I say, no, no, no 
 
CHORUS 


 


QUICKSAND

 
 
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn 
Immersed in Crowley's uniform 
Of imagery 
I'm living in a silent film 
Portraying 
Himmler's sacred realm 
Of dream reality 
I'm frightened by the total goal 
Drawing to the ragged hole 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
No I ain't got the power anymore 
 
I'm the twisted name 
on Garbo's eyes 
Living proof of 
Churchill's lies 
I'm destiny 
I'm torn between the light and dark 
Where others see their targets 
Divine symmetry 
Should I kiss the viper's fang 
Or herald loud 
the death of Man 
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
 
CHORUS 
Don't believe in yourself 
Don't deceive with belief 
Knowledge comes 
with death's release 
 
I'm not a prophet 
or a stone age man 
Just a mortal 
with the potential of a superman 
I'm living on 
I'm tethered to the logic 
of Homo Sapien 
Can't take my eyes 
from the great salvation 
Of bullshit faith 
If I don't explain what you ought to know 
You can tell me all about it 
On, the next Bardo 
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
 
CHORUS 


 


RAMONA A. STONE / I AM WITH NAME

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) I was Ramona A. Stone I started with no enemies of my own I was an artiste In a tunnel But I've been having a mid life crisis And I've been dreaming in a sleep And ape men with metal parts I've spat upon deeply felt age I've hid my hearts in And I hate the funny colored english We'll creep together you and I For I know who the small friends are I am with name, I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A night fear female Good timing drone I am with name, I am with name I am with name, I am with name I am Ramona A Stone She should say: twitch & stream It'll end in chrome Night of the female good time drone I am with name I am Ramona A Stone She should say: I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A person who loses a name Feels anxiety descending Left at the crossroads, between the centuries A millenium fetish I am with name, I am with name I am Ramona A Stone I am with name Night fear female Good timing drone I am with name I am Ramona A Stone I am Ramona A Stone [Give it to me one more time!] 7 Anxiety descending Anxiety descending 


REALITY

 Tragic youth was looking young and sexy 
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans 
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief 
The tragic youth was going down on me 
 
And I swear 
Woo hoo 
Yes I swear 
 
I built a wall of sound to separate us 
And hid among the junk of wretched highs 
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha 
Struggling for reality 
 
Ha ha ha ha 
Woo hoo 
Ha ha ha ha 
Whoo hoo 
 
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight 
Da da da da da da da da da 
Now my death is more than just a sad song 
Da da da da da da da da da 
And I swear 
Woo hoo 
Yes I swear 
Woo hoo 
 
I still don't remember how this happened 
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys 
I look for sense but I get next to nothing 
Hey boy welcome to reality 
 
Ha ha ha ha 
Woo hoo 
 
I've been right and I've been wrong 
Now I'm back where I started from 
Never looked over reality's shoulder 
 
Ha ha ha ha 
Huh ha ha ha 
Woo hoo 
 
Huh ha ha 
Wooh 
Woo hoo 
Wooh

 


REBEL REBEL

 
 
 
You ve got your mother in a whirl 
She s not sure if you re a boy or a girl 
 
Hey babe, your hair s alright 
Hey babe, let s go out tonight 
You like me, and I like it all 
We like dancing and we look divine 
You love bands when they re playing hard 
You want more and you want it fast 
They put you down, they say I m wrong 
You tacky thing, you put them on 
 
CHORUS

CHORUS 
 
You ve torn your dress, your face is a mess 
You can t get enough, but enough ain t the test 
You ve got your transmission and your live wire 
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes 
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes 
And I love your dress 
You re a juvenile success 
Because your face is a mess 
So how could they know? 
I said, how could they know? 
 
So what you wanna know Calamity s child, 
Where d you wanna go? 
What can I do for you? Looks like you ve been there too 
 Cause you ve torn your dress 
And your face is a mess 
Ooo, your face is a mess 
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know? 
Eh, eh, how could they know? 


 


RED MONEY

 (Lyrics by Bowie 
Music by Bowie/Alomar) 
 
 
Oh, can you feel it in the way 
That a man is not a man? 
Can you see it in the sky 
That the landscape is too high? 
 
Like a nervous disease 
And it's been there all along 
It will tumble from the sky 
It's been there all along 
 
Project cancelled 
Tumbling central 
Red Money 
 
CHORUS 
Can you hear it fall 
Can you hear it well 
Can you hear it at all 
 
I was really feeling good 
Reet Petite and how d'ya do 
Then I got the small red box 
And I didn't know what to do 
'Cause my fingers 
could not grope 
And I could not give it away 
And I knew I must not drop it 
Stop it, take it away

RED SAILS

 Feel a bit roughed up, feel a bit frightened 
Nearly pin it down some time 
Red sail action wake up in the wrong town 
Boy, I really get around 
 
Thunder ocean 
Thunder ocean 
Red sails take me, make me sail along 
 
Red sails, and a mast so tall 
Red sails 
Red sails 
 
Do you remember we another person 
Green and black and red and so scared 
Graffiti on the wall kept us all in tune 
Bringing us all back home 
 
Red sails 
Thunder ocean 
Red sails 
Sailor can't dance like you, ooh, yooou 
 
Ahh, red sail 
Red sail action

Action boy seen living under neon 
Struggle with a foreign tongue 
Red sails make him strong 
Action make him sail along 
Life stands still and stares 
 
The hinterland, the hinterland 
We're gonna sail to the hinterland 
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away 
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da

REPETITION

 Johnny is a man 
And he's bigger than you 
But his overheads are high 
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are 
 
He'll get home around seven 
'Cause the chevy's real old 
And he could have had a cadillac 
If the school had taught him right 
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse 
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse 
 
And the food is on the table 
But the food is cold 
(Don't hit her) 
 
 Can't you even cook? 
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook? 
 
Well Johnny is a man 
And he's bigger than her 
I guess the bruises won't show 
If she wears long sleeves 
But the space in her eyes shows through 
 
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse 
 
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse 
 
Shows through 
Shows through 
Shows through

REPTILE

 She spreads herself wide open 
to let the insects in 
She leaves a trail of honey 
to show me where she's been 
She has the blood of reptile 
just underneath her skin 
Seeds from a thousand others 
drip down from within 
 
Oh my beautiful liar 
Oh my precious whore 
My disease my infection 
I am so impure 
 
Devils speak of the ways 
in which she'll manifest 
Angels bleed 
from the tainted touch of my caress 
 
Need to contaminate 
to alleviate this loneliness 
I now know the depths 
I reach are limitless 
 
Oh my beautiful liar 
Oh my precious whore 
My disease my infection 
I am so impure

 


RICOCHET

 
 
Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe 
Ricochet Ricochet 
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs 
Ricochet Ricochet 
Turn the holy pictures 
so they face the wall 
And who can bear to be forgotten 
And who can bear to be forgotten 
March of flowers March of dimes 
These are the prisons, these are the crimes 
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep 
 
Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery 
Mine shafts, things like that 
March of flowers March of dimes 
These are the prisons, these are the crimes 
Sound of thunder, sound of gold 
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole 
Ricochet It's not the end of the world 
Sound of thunder, sound of gold 
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole 
Ricochet Ricochet 
These are the prisons, these are the crimes 
Teaching life in a violent new way 
Ricochet Ricochet 
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall 
And who can bear to be forgotten 
And who can bear to be forgotten 
March of flowers, march of dimes 
These are the prisons, these are the crimes 
Early, before the sun, 
they struggle off to the gates 
In their secret fearful places 
they see their lives 
Unravelling before them 
March of flowers, march of dimes 
These are the prisons, these are the crimes 
Sound of thunder, sound of gold 
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole 
Ricochet 
it's not the end of the world 
 
But when they get home, 
damp eyed and weary 
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests 
Making unfulfillable promises 
For who can bear to be forgotten

ROCK 'N' ROLL SUICIDE

 
 
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth 
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your 
cigarette 
The wall to wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget 
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide 
 
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it 
 
And the clock waits so patiently on your song 
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived 
too long 
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suciide 
 
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road 
 
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home 
Don't let the sun blast your shadow 
Don't let the milk float ride your mind 
You're so natural religiously unkind 
 
 
Oh no love! you're not alone 
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair 
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care 
Oh no love! you're not alone 
No matter what or who you've been 
No matter when or where you've seen 
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain 
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain 
You're not alone 
 
Just turn on with me and you're not alone 
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone 
Let's turn on and be not alone 
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful (x2) 
Oh gimme your hands. 


 


ROCK N ROLL WITH ME

 (Words by Bowie, music by Bowie/Peace) 
 
You always were the one that knew 
They sold us for the likes of you 
I always wanted new surroundings 
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat 
Trying to remember who to meet 
 
I would take a foxy kind of stand 
While tens of thousands found me in demand 
 
CHORUS 
When you rock n roll with me 
No one else I d rather be 
Nobody here can do it for me 
I m in tears again 
When you rock n roll with me 
 
Gentle hearts are counted down 
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds 
Me, I m out of breath, but not quite doubting 
I ve found a door which lets me out! 
 
CHORUS (x3) 


 


ROSALYN

 (Jimmy Duncan/Bill Farley) 
 
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been 
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been 
All the night and all the day 
Hide and seek's the game you play 
Treat me as sure as sin 
 
Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn 
 
VERSE 
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me 
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me 
When I'm holding you so tight 
It's so hard to say goodnight 
It's you that I love now can't you see? 
 
CHORUS 
Do you really love me, do you love me true 
Do you really love me Rosalyn? 
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know 
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

CHORUS 
 
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know

RUBBER BAND

 
 
Rubber band 
There s a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune 
In the library garden Sunday afternoon 
While a little chappie waves a golden wand 
 
Rubber band 
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong 
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long 
 
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes 
 
Dear Rubber band, you re playing my tunes out of tune, oh 
 
Rubber band, Won t you play a haunting theme again to me 
 
While I eat my scones and drink my cup 
of tea 
 
The sun is warm but it s a lonely afternoon 
Oh, play that theme 
 
Rubber band 
How I wish that I could join your Rubber band 
We could play in lively parks throughout the land 
And one Sunday afternoon I d find my love 
 
Rubber band 
In 14 18 war I went to sea 
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me 
 
And now she s married to the leader of the band, oh 
(spoken) 
Oh sob I hope you break your baton 


 


RUN

 (K.Armstrong/D.Bowie) 
 
Wish I were a sailor 
Crossing an azure sea 
Under leaden skies 
Under your eyes 
 
But I can't see too far 
With these animal eyes 
Can't hold my breath 
Without your voice 
 
An' I'm danger prone 
I'll be bound 
I'll be fast as hell 
Without your touch 
 
CHORUS 
An' I'll run run run run run 
An' I'll run run run run run 
Without your love 
 
I'm a goldman 
I'm a soaring tower 
And it's cold in here 
Without your love 
 
Trouble in here trouble out there 
Mainline problems 
till you no longer care 
Get a long low life 
it's duty bound 
No hope no life 
no you ah ha 
 
CHORUS 
I duck the shots tilt the world 
I talk myself crazy shoot the breeze 
Shout to live shoot to kill 
Double up in pain I'm on my knees 


 


RUNNING GUN BLUES

 
 
I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy 
So I better get away, better make it today 
I've cut twenty three down since Friday 
But I can't control it, my face is drawn 
My instinct still emotes it 
 
 
I slash them cold, I kill them dead 
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads 
I'll bomb them out from under the beds 
But now I've got the running gun blues 
 
 
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war 
Left generals squashed and stifled 
But I'll slip out again tonight 
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle 
For I promote oblivion 
And I'll plug a few civilians 
 
 
 
I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead 
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads 
I'll slice them till they're running red 
But now I've got the running gun blues

 


SACRIFICE YOURSELF

 (D.Bowie/T.Sales/H.Sales) 
 
Some days he feels so empty 
Just a talking head 
Married to a Klingon 
Who could cream him in the press 
God could detonate him 
God's the one we pick to curse us 
And 35 years pass him 
Like an evening at the circus 
 
CHORUS 
Don't sacrifice yourself 
Sacrifice yourself 
Surprise yourself 
Don't sacrifice yourself 
 
There it is, the look, the winner you 
Once talked of being 
Give her one last kiss and 
Dive right out the window screaming 
No truth decent, It was summer from the waist down 
She blew the troops right off your feet 
She tells you she's God's grammy 
 
CHORUS 
Her, the only game in town, a queen of competence 
Blind in front of mirrors, proving nothings says a lot 
 
Wham bam thank you Charlie 
Vanity is all 
You wander lonely to the scene 
A crawling up the walls 


 


SAVIOUR MACHINE

 
 
President Joe once had a dream 
The world held his hand, gave their pledge 
 
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine 
 
They called it the Prayer, its answer was law 
Its logic stopped war, gave them food 
How they adored till it cried in its boredom 
 
 
 
'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me 
 
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now 
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all 
 
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay 
My logic says burn so send me away 
 
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen 
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine 
 
I need you flying, and I'll show that dying 
 
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time 
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind 
 
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay 
My logic says burn so send me away 
 
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen 
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

 


SCARY MONSTERS (AND SUPER CREEPS)

 
 
She had an horror of rooms 
she was tired 
you can't hide beat 
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home 
 
She could've been a killer 
if she didn't walk the way she do, 
and she do 
She opened strange doors 
that we'd never close again 
 
She began to wail jealousies scream 
Waiting at the light know what I mean 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
Scary monsters, super creeps 
Keep me running, running scared 
 
She asked me to stay 
and I stole her room 
She asked for my love 
and I gave her a dangerous mind 
Now she's stupid in the street 
and she can't socialise 
Well I love the little girl 
and I'll love her till the day she dies 
 
She wails 
Jimmy's guitar sound 
jealousies scream 
Waiting at the light know what I mean 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
 
Run, Run, Run (ad lib) 


 


SCREAM LIKE A BABY

 
 
Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise 
And I wouldn't go to war 
And I mixed with other colours 
But the nurse doesn't care 
And I hide under blankets 
Or did I run away 
I really can't remember 
Last time I saw the light of day 
 
But I remember Sam 
'cause he was like me 
 
CHORUS 
Scream like a baby 
Sam was a gun 
And I never knew his last name 
And we never had no fun 
 
Well they came down hard on the faggots 
And they came down hard on the street 
They came down harder on Sam 
And they all knew he was beat 
He was thrown into the wagon 
Blindfolded, chains, 
and they stomped on us 
And took away our clothes and things 
And pumped us full of strange drugs 
And oh I saw Sam falling 
Spitting in their eyes 
But now I lay me down to sleep 
And now I close my eyes 
Now I'm learning 
to be a part of soc society 
 
CHORUS 
 
No athletic program, 
no discipline, no book 
 
He just sat in the backseat 
swearing he'd seek revenge 
But he jumped into the furnace 
Singing old songs we loved 
 
CHORUS (twice) 


 


SEE EMILY PLAY

 (Syd Barrett) 
 
Emily tries but misunderstands 
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til 
tomorrow 
 
CHORUS 
There is no other day 
Let's try it another way 
You'll lose your mind and play 
Free games for May 
See Emily play 
 
Soon after dark Emily cries 
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow 
 
CHORUS 
 
Put on a gown that touches the ground 
Float on a river for ever and ever 
Emily 
 
CHORUS 


 


SELL ME A COAT

 
 
La la la la la la, la la la la la la la 
A winter s day, a bitter snowflake on my 
face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain t so cool 
 
 
CHORUS 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that s red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold 
 
 
 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
 
CHORUS 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That s a memory of the summer day 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
La la la la la la (repeat) 


 


SEVEN

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
I forgot what my father said 
I forgot what he said 
I forgot what my mother said 
as we layed upon your bed 
 
A city full of flowers 
a city full of rain 
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 
 
I forgot what my brother said 
I forgot what he said 
I don't regret anything at all 
I remember how he wept 
 
On a bridge of violent people 
I was small enough to cry 
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 
 
Hold my face before you 
still my trembling heart 
Seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 
 
The Gods forgot they've made me 
so I forgot them to 
I listen to the shadows 
I play among their graves 
 
My heart is never broken 
my patience never tried 
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 
Seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 
 
 
Seven 


 


SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels Lyrics Bowie) 
 
 Are you OK? 
You've been shot in the head 
And I'm holding your brains 
The old woman said 
So I drink in the shadows 
Of an evening sky 
See nothing at all 
 
The stars look so special 
And the snow looks so old 
The frail form is drifting 
Beyond the orc's zone 
Time to question the mountain 
Why pigs can fly 
It's nothing at all 
 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes away 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes 
I praise to you 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes away 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes away 
I praise to you 
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes 
Nothing 


 


SEX AND THE CHURCH

 
 
Though the idea of convulsion/confession? 
is said to be 
The union of christ and his bride 
The christian 
It's all very puzzling 
 
Sex and the church (x3) 
And the church...and the church 
 
All the great mystic religions 
Put strong emphasis, on 
The redeeming spiritual qualities 
Of sex...of sex 
Christianity 
Has been pretty modern 
About sex 
 
Of sex (x4) 
Sex and the church (x3) 
Sex...sex 
 
I think there is a union 
Between the flesh and the spirit 
Sex and the church (x2) 
 
 
All religions' mother (spoken) 
 
VERSE (twice) 
Give me the freedom of spirit 
And the joys of the flesh 
And sex...sex... 
Sex and the church 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
Sex and the church (x3) 
And the church...and the church 
Sex 
Sex 
Sex and the church (x3) 
Sex...sex...sex 
 
Sex 
 
Sex and the church (x3) 
Sex...sex 


 


SHADOW MAN

 There's a man back a ways 
Who believes at where he is 
And there's a girl 
Up ahead who says she knows 
And the street overflows 
With the folk who understand 
But for the guy who can't be seen 
He's the Shadow Man 
And the Shadow Man is close at hand 
Take a turn and see his smile 
Made of nothing but loneliness 
Just take a walk and be a friend 
To the Shadow Man 
You can call him Joe, 
you can call him Sam 
You should call and see who answers 
For he promises to come running, 
guided by the truth 
But the Shadow Man is really you 
Look in his eyes 
and see your reflection 
Look to the stars and see his eyes 
He'll show you tomorrow, 
he'll show you the sorrows 
Of what you did today 
You can call him foe, 
you can call him friend 
You should call and see who answers 
For he knows your eyes 
are drawn to the road ahead 
 
And the Shadow Man 
is waiting round the bend 
Oh, the Shadow Man 
Ohooooo oooo 
Shadow man, shadow man 
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you 
He's the shadow man 
Oh yeah 
Shadow man 
 
Shadow Man 
Is waiting up ahead 
Shadow Man 
Waiting up ahead 
Is waiting up ahead

 


SHAKE IT

 
 
I feel like a sail boat 
Adrift on the sea 
It's a brand new day 
So when you gonna phone me 
 
I could take you to heaven 
I could spin you to hell 
But I'll take you to New York 
It's the place that I know well 
 
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl 
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well 
 
I duck and I sway What's my line 
Shoot at a full moon What's my line 
What's my line Shake it baby 
 
Cause love is the answer 
Love's talking to me 
I'd scream and I'll fight for you 
You're better than money 
 
We're the kind of people 
who can shake it 
if we're feeling blue 
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do 
Shake it baby 


 


SHAPES OF THINGS

 (Samwell Smith/McCarty/Relf) 
 
Shapes of things before my eyes 
Just teach me to despise 
Will time make man more wise 
Here within my lonely frame 
My eyes just hurt my brain 
But will it seem the same 
 
CHORUS 
(Come tomorrow), will I be older 
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier 
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today 
 
Now the trees are almost green 
But will they still be seen 
When time and tide have been 
Boy into your passing hands 
Please don't destroy these lands 
Don't make them desert sands 
 
CHORUS 
 
Soon I hope that I will find 
A seed within my mind 
That won't disgrace my kind 


 


SHE S GOT MEDALS

 
 
She d walk through the door and she d set up the drinks 
on the house 
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped 
her back 
And never took her out 
She wore a trenchcoat khaki 
Her hobnail boots were full of holes 
She s got medals 
Her mother called her Mary, she changed her name to Tommy, 
she s a one, oh 
She went and joined the army, passed the medical 
Don t ask me how it s done 
They sent her to the front line 
Fighting for her country s name 
She s got medals 
She got very tired of picking up girls 
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls 
Then the enemy dropped a bomb 
Survivors there were none 
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed 
You can see her ghost but that s a lie because the naughty woman isn t dead 
She deserted on the previous morning 
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green 
Called herself Eileen 
Came to London town 
Now she s settled down 
She s got medals 


 


SHE SHOOK ME COLD

 
 
We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still 
She sucked my dormant will 
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again 
My God, she shook me cold 
 
I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair 
And threw her to the ground 
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said 
My God, she should be told 
 
I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts 
Of many young virgins 
 
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely 
They'd just give up trying 
 
Then she took my head, smashed it up 
Kept my young blood rising 
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around 
 
So she didn't know I crave her so o o 
 
I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again 
We met upon a hill 
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again 
My God, she shook me cold 


 


SHE'LL DRIVE THE BIG CAR

 She waited by the moon 
She was sick with fear and cold 
She felt too old for all of this 
Of course she never showed 
She lugged her suitcase to the bus 
Melted home through the snow 
North along riverside 
 
She slips beneath the sheets 
A husbands quiet devoted wife 
But strangers sad and nervous 
By the dawns early light 
Loves lies like a dead cloud 
On a shabby, yellow lawn 
Up on riverside 
 
She'll drive the big car 
He'll sit behind 
She'll keep an eye on Jessica 
South along the Hudson 
 
She'll turn the radio high 
Find a station playing sad, sad soul 
Just a little bit louder now 
South along the Hudson yea 
 
Just a little bit faster now 
Just a little bit louder now 
Just a little bit angry now 
South along the Hudson, yea 
 
And she'll drive the big car 
And talk herself insane 
Just a little bit louder now 
Just a little bit angry now 
 
Way back when Millennium 
Meant racing to the light 
He promised her a dream life 
He'd take her back to street life 
 
Away from violent water 
With its Cormorants and leaves 
Up on riverside 
 
She'll drive the big car 
But he'll sit behind 
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand 
South along the Hudson 
She'll turn the radio way up high 
Find a station playing sad, sad soul 
 
Just a little bit louder now 
South along the Hudson 
 
Just a little bit faster now 
Just a little bit louder now 
Just a little bit angry now 
South along the Hudson, yea 
 
Just a little bit faster now 
Just a little bit louder now 
Just a little bit angry now 
South along the Hudson, yea 
 
She'll drive the big car 
He'll sit behind 
She'll keep an eye on Jessica 
Just a little bit faster now 
Just a little bit faster now

 


SHINING STAR (MAKIN' MY LOVE)

 
 
Eddie boy lit like paraffin 
spending two weeks 
in a crack house 
Burns on his brain 
like Chernobyl 
 
Dean was seen 
with a two bag purchase 
He was lying dead on his mother's bed 
Someone for pray for 
till I met you 
 
Life is like a broken arrow 
memory a swingin' door 
I could be your great misfortune 
I can make you happy 
every day of your life 
Making my love 
like a shining star 
takin' my love just a touch too far 
 
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 
cause love left holes 
And four swell kids breaking her heart 
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, 
I've touched down with vermin, 
Cowardice, lice, 
And I say 
 
Nobody cares what you do 
please be yourself to death 
 
I could be your great misfortune 
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man. 
 
Making my love 
like a shining star 
Taking my love just a touch too far. 
 
Peter met Frank 
formed a dummy run gang 
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat 
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn 
Fein, Hitler cashdown 
No hope heroes cover the page 
with debts in hell 
And fingers in blood 
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
threw it all away 
Another life in the grave 
Another life in the grave 
 
Life is like a broken arrow 
memory a swingin' door 
I could be your great misfortune 
Well I could make you happy 
every goddamn single day of your life 
 
Making my love 
like a shining star 
Like a shining star 
Baby that's what you are 
Like a shining star 
 
Making my love 
like a shining star 
Taking my love 
Just a touch too far 


 


SHOPPING FOR GIRLS

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Between the dead ring ash 
of extreme defence 
The lonely groups of company boys 
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs 
and toothy grins 
These are children riding naked 
on their tourist pals 
 
While the hollows that pass for eyes 
swell from withdrawal 
And he lies on a mattress 
in a rat infested room 
 
Talking 'bout his family 
and the cold back home 
 
 
CHORUS 
Between the dull cold eyes 
and the mind unstable 
None over here reads the papers 
pal 
'tween the dull cold eyes 
and the mind unstable 
He's a clean trick 
and he's shopping for girls 
 
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard 
 
Cranking up the volume 
of a Michael Jackson song 
 
CHORUS 
 
Where the frangipani scents the air 
She mouths a word 
that breaks his stare 
 
He grunts his reply 
in a garrulous croak 
 That's a mighty big word 
for a nine year old 
 
CHORUS 
 
Shopping for girls, shopping for girls 
 
You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles 
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll 


 


SILLY BOY BLUE

 
 
Montains of Lhasa are feeling the rain 
People are walking the Botella lanes 
Preacher takes the school 
One boy breaks a rule 
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue 
 
Yak butter statues that melt in sun 
Cannot dissolve all the work you ve not down 
A chela likes to feel 
That his overself pays the bill 
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue 
 
 
You wish and wish, and wish again 
You ve tried so hard to fly 
You ll never leave your body now 
You ve got to wait to die 
La la la la la la la la la la (x2) 
La la la la la (x2) 
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue 
Child of the Tibet, you re a gift from the sun 
Reincarnation of one better man 
The homeward road is long 
You ve left your prayers and song 
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue 
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue 


 


SLIP AWAY

 () 
 
Oogie waits for just another day 
Drags his bones 
to see the Yankees play 
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray 
Oh, they slip away 
 
Once a time 
they nearly might have been 
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen 
No one knew what they could do 
Except for me and you 
They slip away 
They slip away 
 
Don't forget 
to keep your head warm 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
Watching all the world 
and war torn 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo o 
Sailing over 
Coney Island 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
We were dumb 
but you were fun, boy 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo o 
 
Oogie knew there's never ever time 
Some of us will always stay behind 
Down in space it's always 1982 
The joke we always knew 
Oo oo 
What'sa matter with you 
C'mon, let's go 
Slip away 
Oo o 
 
Don't forget

How I wonder where you are

SLOW BURN

 () 
 
Here shall we live in this terrible town Where the price for our minds 
shall squeeze them tight like a fist 
And the walls shall have eyes 
And the doors shall have ears 
But we'll dance in their dark 
And they'll play with our lives 
 
Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we 
So small in times such as these 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 
 
Oh, these are the days 
These are the strangest of all 
These are the nights 
These are the darkest to fall 
But who knows? 
Echoes in tenement halls 
Who knows? 
Though the years spare them all 
 
Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Twirling us round and round 
and upside down 
There's fear overhead 
There's fear overground 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 
Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Turning us round and round and round And here are we 
At the center of it all 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn

 


SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME

 
 
He s everybody s token, on everybody s wall 
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all 
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies 
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall 
He s so divine, his soul shines 
Breaks the night, sleep tight 
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race 
He says I m somebody 
He s got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart 
 
He says Don t hurry, baby 
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me 
He s the savage son of the TV tube 
Planets wrote the day was due 
All the wisest men around 
Predicted that a man was found 
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah 
Everyone with sense could see 
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he 
Had the plan, he had to use 
He s so divine, his soul shines 
Breaks the night, sleep tight 
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race 
 
He says I m somebody 
He s got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart 
 
He says Don t hurry, baby 
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me 
Somebody plays my song in tune 
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe 
Was a way when we were young, that 
Any man was judged by what he d done 
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like) 
Where they ve been 
CHORUS 2 
He s got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart 
 
He says Don t hurry, baby 
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me 
Leaders come, they hate all the people know 
That given time, the leaders go 
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell 
Can they walk and hold you as well as a 
Smile like Valentino? 
Could he sell you anything? 
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart 
 
He says Don t hurry, baby 
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me 
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody 
Yeah, can t remember (somebody) peace so well 
 
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to 
boogie 
 
Soul shine (Ooh ooh) 
So divine 
Somebody (ooh ooh, somebody) 
Soul shine (Ooh ooh) 
So divine 
Somebody (ooh ooh) 
Somebody, somebody, somebody

SOMETHING IN THE AIR

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Your coat and hat are gone 
I really can't look at your little empty shelf 
A ragged teddy bear 
It feels like we never had a chance 
Don't look me in the eye 
 
 
We lay in each others arms 
But the room is just an empty space 
I guess we lived it out 
Something in the air 
We smiled too fast 
then can't think of a thing to say 
 
 
Lived with the best times 
Left with the worst 
I've danced with you too long 
Nothing left to say 
 
Let's take what we can 
I know you hold your head up high 
We've raced for the last time 
A place of no return 
 
And there's something in the air 
Something in my eye 
I've danced with you too long 
Something in the air 
Something in my eye 
 
Abracadoo I lose you 
We can't avoid the clash 
The big mistake 
Now we're gona pay and pay 
The sentence of our lives 
Can't believe I'm asking you to go 
 
 
We used what we could 
To get the things we want 
But we lost each other on the way 
I guess you know I never wanted 
anyone more than you 
 
Lived all our best times 
Left with the worst 
I've danced with you to long 
Say what you will 
 
But there's something in the air 
Raced for the last time 
Well I know you hold your head up high 
There's nothing we have to say 
There's nothing in my eyes 
But there's something in the air 
Something in my eye 
I've danced with you too long 
There's something I have to say 
There's something in the air 
Something in my eye 
I've danced with you too long 


 


SONG FOR BOB DYLAN

 
 
Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman 
I wrote a song for you 
About a strange young man 
called Dylan 
With a voice like sand and glue 
His words of truthful vengeance 
They could pin us to the floor 
Brought a few more people on 
And put the fear in a whole lot more 
 
Ah, Here she comes 
Here she comes 
Here she comes again 
The same old painted lady 
From the brow of a superbrain 
She'll scratch this world to pieces 
As she comes on like a friend 
But a couple of songs 
From your old scrapbook 
Could send her home again 
 
You gave your heart to every bedsit room 
At least a picture on my wall 
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes 
And told them how they saw 
Then we lost your train of thought 
The paintings are all your own 
While troubles are rising 
We'd rather be scared 
Together than alone 
 
Ah, Here she comes...etc. 
 
Now hear this Robert Zimmerman 
Though I don't suppose we'll meet 
Ask your good friend Dylan 
If he'd gaze a while 
down the old street 
Tell him we've lost his poems 
So they're writing on the walls 
Give us back our unity 
Give us back our family 
You're every nation's refugee 
Don't leave us with their sanity 
 
Ah, Here she comes....etc. 


 


SORROW

 (Feldman/Goldstein/Gottehrer) 
 
 
With your long blonde hair 
and your eyes of blue 
The only thing I ever got from you 
was sorrow 
Sorrow 
You acted funny trying 
to spend my money 
 
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow 
Sorrow 
 
You never do what you know you oughta 
Something tells me 
you're a Devil's daughter 
Sorrow, sorrow 
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh 
 
I tried to find her 
'Cause I can't resist her 
(I tried to find her) 
I never knew just how much I missed her 
Sorrow 
Sorrow 
 
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow 
Sorrow 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh oh 
 
With your long blonde hair 
I couldn't sleep last night 
With your long blonde hair 


 


SORRY

 (H. Sales) 
 
Time is tight 
love always gets in the way 
I'm sorry 
 
Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do 
I'm sorry 
I'm so sorry 
 
I'm so sorry 
I'm sorry 
You know I am 
 
Well my eyes are pinned 
and my money's spent 
I'm sorry 
You know I'm sorry 
I wouldn't do for me 
what I would for you 
Would you forgive me 
I'm sorry 
I'm so sorry 
 
I guess I've thrown it away 
I've thrown it away 
Didn't mean to do it that way 
I'm sorry 
Time is so tight 
And I mean it if I say 
I'm so sorry 
I didn't mean to hurt you 
I'm sorry 
 
I'm sorry 
I'm sor rrr ry 
You know I am 


 


SOUL LOVE

 
 
Stone love she kneels before the grave 
A brave son who gave his life 
to save the slogans 
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes 
For they penetrate her grieving 
 
New love a boy and girl are talking 
New words that only they can share in 
New words a love so strong it tears their hearts 
 
 
 
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning 
 
CHORUS 
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby 
Love descends on those defenceless 
Idiot love will spark the fusion 
Inspirations have I none 
Just to touch the flaming dove 
All I have is my love of love 
And love is not loving 
 
 
 
Soul love the priest that tastes the word and 
Told of love and how my God on high is 
All love though reaching up my loneliness 
evolves 
By the blindness that surrounds him 
 
 
 
CHORUS 


 


SOUND AND VISION

 
 
Don't you wonder sometimes 
'Bout sound and vision 
 
Blue, blue, electric blue 
That's the colour of my room 
Where I will live 
Blue, blue 
 
Pale blinds drawn all day 
Nothing to do, nothing to say 
Blue, blue 
 
I will sit right down, 
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision 
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision 
Drifting into my solitude, 
over my head 
 
Don't you wonder sometimes 
'Bout sound and vision 


 


SPACE ODDITY

 
 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on 
 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Commencing countdown, 
engines on 
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you 
 
(spoken) 
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff 
 
This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom 
You've really made the grade 
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear 
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare 
 
This is Major Tom to Ground Control 
I'm stepping through the door 
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way 
And the stars look very different today 
 
For here 
Am I sitting in a tin can 
Far above the world 
Planet Earth is blue 
And there's nothing I can do 
 
Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles 
I'm feeling very still 
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go 
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows 
 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Your circuit's dead, 
there's something wrong 
Can you hear me, Major Tom? 
Can you hear me, Major Tom? 
Can you hear me, Major Tom? 
Can you.... 
 
Here am I floating 
round my tin can 
Far above the Moon 
Planet Earth is blue 
And there's nothing I can do. 


 


STAR

 
 
Tony went to fight in Belfast 
Rudi stayed at home to starve 
I could make it all worthwhile 
as a rock & roll star 
Bevan tried to change the nation 
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that 
he tried 
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star 
 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
So inviting so enticing to play the part 
I could play the wild mutation 
as a rock & roll star 
I could do with the money 
I'm so wiped out with things as they are 
I'd send my photograph to my honey and I'd c'mon like 
a regular superstar 
 
 
I could fall asleep at night 
as a rock & roll star 
I could fall in love all right 
as a rock & roll star 


 


STARMAN

 
 
Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low 
I leaned back on my radio 
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, 
he said 
 
Then the loud sound did seem to fade 
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase 
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive 
 
CHORUS 
There's a starman waiting in the sky 
He'd like to come and meet us 
But he thinks he'd blow our minds 
There's a starman waiting in the sky 
He's told us not to blow it 
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile 
He told me: 
Let the children lose it 
Let the children use it 
Let all the children boogie 
 
 
 
I had to phone someone so I picked on you 
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too! 
Switch on the TV 
we may pick him up on channel two 
Look out your window I can see his light 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If we can sparkle he may land tonight 
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright 
 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 


 


STATESIDE

 (H. Sales/Bowie) 
 
I'm going home 
I've been gone much too long 
She said she missed me 
Since I been gone 
I'll be back soon 
Ain't no doubt 
'Cause she said she wanted 
my loving, my loving 
 
CHORUS (Twice) 
No holding back I'm going home 
No holding back I'm going home 
I'm going stateside with my convictions 
 
I said I'm coming home soon 
I don't know when 
It will be sometime soon 
Sooner than 
I thought I'd be 
I thought I'd be 
I thought I'd be 
stateside sooner than later 
 
Marilyn inflatables home on the range 
Where the living is easy 
on a horse with no name 
Kennedy convertibles home on the range 
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain 
I'm going stateside 
I'm going stateside 
 
 
I'm going home 
It's been so long 
She said she missed me 
And all the fun we've had 
I think it be the best way 
She said she missed me in 
Every, every way, so 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
 
I've been gone so long 
I've been gone, I've been gone 
I'm missing you 
 
Marilyn inflatables home on the range 
Where the living is easy 
on a horse with no name 
Kennedy convertibles home on the range 
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise 
I'm going stateside 
I'm going stateside 


 


STATION TO STATION

 
The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts 
in lovers' eyes 
Here are we one magical moment 
Such is the stuff from 
where dreams are woven 
Bending sound 
Dredging the ocean lost in my circle 
Here am I 
Flashing no colour tall in this room 
overlooking the ocean 
 
Here are we 
One magical movement 
from Kether to Malkuth 1 
There are you 
You drive like a demon 
from station to station 
The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts 
in lovers' eyes (x2) 
The return of the Thin White Duke, 
making sure white stains 
 
Once there were mountains on mountains 
And once there were sunbirds 
to soar with 
And once I could 
never be down 
Got to keep searching 
and searching 
Oh what will I be believing 
and who will connect me with love? 
 
Wonder who wonder who 
wonder when 
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy? 
Drink to the men who protect you and I 
Drink drink drain your glass 
raise your glass high 
 
CHORUS 1 
It's not the side effects of the cocaine 
I'm thinking that it must be love 
It's too late 
 to be grateful 
It's too late 
 to be late again 
It's too late 
 to be hateful 
The european cannon is here 
 
CHORUS 2 
I must be only one in a million 
I won't let the day pass 
without her 
It's too late 
 to be grateful 
It's too late 
 to be late again 
It's too late 
 to be hateful 
The European cannon is here 
 
 
CHORUS 3 
Should I believe that I've been stricken? 
Does my face show 
some kind of glow? 
It's too late 
 to be grateful 
It's too late 
 to be late again 
It's too late 
 to be hateful 
The european cannon is here, yes it's here 
 
It's too late (5 times) 
The European cannon is here 
 
CHORUS 1 
 
CHORUS 2 
 
CHORUS 3 
 
It's too late (repeat ab inf) 


 


STAY

 
 
This week dragged past me 
so slowly 
The days fell on their knees 
Maybe I'll take something to help me 
Hope someone takes after me 
I guess there's always some change in the weather 
This time I know we could 
get it together 
If I did casually mention tonight 
That would be crazy tonight 
 
CHORUS 
Stay that's what I meant to say or do something 
But what I never say is 
stay this time 
I really meant to so bad this time 
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody wants something you want too 
 
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, 
make me delight 
Right is so vague when it brings someone new 
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do 
I know it's happened to you 
 
Stay that's what I meant to say or do something 
But what I never say is 
stay this time 
I really meant to so bad this time 
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody 
Wants something or wants to stay 
 
CHORUS 


 


STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET

 (Music & Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
All my friends 
Now seem so thin and frail 
Slinky secrets 
Hotter than the sun 
No peachy prayers 
No trendy rechauff� 
I'm with you 
So I can't go on 
 
CHORUS 
All my violence 
Raining tears upon the sheet 
I'm bewildered/resentful 
For we're strangers when we meet 
 
 
Blank screen TV 
Preening ourselves in the snow 
Forget my name 
But I'm over you 
Blended sunrise 
And it's a dying world 
Humming Rheingold 
We scavenge up our clothes 
 
CHORUS 
Cold tired fingers 
Tapping out your memories 
Halfway sadness 
Dazzled by the new 
Your embrace 
Was all that I feared 
That whirling room 
We trade by vendu 
 
Steely resolve 
Is falling from me 
My poor soul 
All bruised passivity 
All your regrets 
Ride rough shod over me 
I'm so glad 
That we're strangers when we meet 
I'm so thankful 
That we're strangers when we meet 
I'm in clover 
For we're strangers when we meet 
Heel head over 
And we're strangers when we meet

SUFFRAGETTE CITY

 
 
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know 
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta 
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face 
This mellow thighed chick 
Just put my spine out of place 
 
Hey man, my schooldays insane 
Hey man, my work's down the drain 
Hey man, well she's a total blam blam 
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she... 
 
 
(CHORUS) 
Oh don't lean on me man 
Cause you can't afford the ticket 
I'm back on Suffragette City 
Oh don't lean on me man 
Cause you ain't got time to check it 
You know my Suffragette City 
Is outta sight...she's all right 
 
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away 
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way 
Hey man, droogie don't crash here 
There's only room for one and here she comes 
Here she comes

Ohhh, Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am!

SUNDAY

 () 
 
Nothing remains 
We could run 
when the rain slows 
Look for the cars or signs of life 
Where the heat goes 
Look for the drifters 
We should crawl under the bracken 
Look for the shafts of light on the road 
Where the heat goes 
 
Everything has changed 
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing 
And nothing has changed 
Everything has changed 
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end 
And nothing has changed 
And everything has changed 
 
(first voice) 
In your fear 
Of what we have become 
Take to the fire 
Now we must burn 
All that we are 
Rise together 
Through these clouds 
As on wings 
 
(2nd voice) 
In your fear, seek only peace 
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, seek only peace 
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, in your fear 
As on wings 
This is the trip 
And this is the business we take 
This is our number 
All my trials, Lord 
Will be remembered 
Everything has changed

 


SURVIVE

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Got Oh my, naked eyes 
I should have kept you 
I should have tried 
I should have been a wiser kind of guy 
I miss you 
 
Give me wings 
Give me space 
Give me money for a change of face 
These noisy rooms and passion pants 
I loved you 
 
Where's the morning in my life? 
Where's the sense in staying right? 
Who said time is on my side? 
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life 
But I survive your naked eyes 
I'll survive 
 
You alone across the floor 
You and me and nothing more 
You're the great mistake I never made 
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied 
But I'll survive your naked eyes 
I'll survive 
 
 
Beatle boys, all snowy white 
Razzle dazzle clubs every night 
Wish I'd sent a Valentine 
I love you 
 
 
I'll survive 
Naked eyes 
I'll survive 
I'll survive 
My naked eyes 
I'll survive

 


SWEET HEAD

 I tried to break away from you 
From the spics and blacks 
and the gum you chew 
Where the posters are torn 
by the muggin' gangs 
By the faggy parks 
and the burnt out vans 
I've got ninety nine years 
of laying in the dark 
and I'm far too young to lie 
I've got ninety nine ways 
to play my guitar 
it's going to pay me before I die 
 
CHORUS 
So bob your sweet head 
Brother Ziggy going to play 
I'm just about 
the best you can hear 
Gonna rock it in your head 
Shazam! and come ball 
With my guitar and me soprano 
We can give you sweet head 
 
I'm tough as glass 
and clean as night 
Well if looks can love 
we can love all right 
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore 
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall 
I had ninety nine years of murder 
called life 
and I'm running away from it all 
I got a bedroom, 
every mirror in town 
they're going to claim me if I fall 
 
CHORUS 
Sweet head, give you sweet head 
(spoken: while ya down there) 
 
See my eyes of blocked emotion, 
see my tremble, see my fall 
Traumatics thick and fast, 
your faith in me can last 
Besides I'm known to lay you, 
one and all 
Look south the way 
your mother dwells 
If she knew what's going down, 
she'd give you hell 
I'm the kind of man 
she warned me of 
Till there was rock, you only had god 
You and I have 
a mutual vow 
We both like young, 
and we both like loud 
I got pretty shoes, 
and I'm kid and proud 
I'm street side out 
with my ear to the crowd 
 
CHORUS 
Move along, sir!

 


SWEET THING

 
 
It s safe in the city, to love in a doorway 
To wrangle some screens from the door 
And isn t it me, putting pain in a stranger? 
 
 
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash 
Will you see that I m scared and I m lonely? 
So I ll break up my room, and yawn and I 
Run to the centre of things 
Where the knowing one says 
 
 
CHORUS 
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing 
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing 
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing 
 Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap 
thing 
 
 
I m glad that you re older than me 
Makes me feel important and free 
Does that make you smile, isn t that me? 
I m in your way, and I ll steal every moment 
 
If his trade is a curse, then I ll bless you 
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and... 
 
CHORUS 


 


SWEET THING (REPRISE)

 
 
If you want it, boys, get it here thing 
 Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing 
 
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain? 
Do you think that your face looks the same? 
Then let it be, it s all I ever wanted 
 
It s a street with a deal, and a taste 
It s got claws, it s got me, it s got you

 


TEENAGE WILDLIFE

 
 
Well, how come you only want tomorrow 
With its promise 
of something hard to do 
A real life adventure 
worth more than pieces of gold 
Blue skies above 
and sun on your arms 
strength in your stride 
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes 
You'll get chilly receptions 
everywhere you go 
Blinded with desire 
 guess the season is on 
 
So you train by shadow boxing, 
search for the truth 
But it's all, but it's all used up 
Break open 
your million dollar weapon 
And you push , still you push, 
still you push your luck 
 
A broken nosed mogul are you 
One of the new wave boys9 
 
Same old thing in brand new drag 
Comes sweeping into view, oh ooh 
As ugly as a teenage millionaire 
Pretending 
it's a whizz kid world 
You'll take me aside, and say 
 Well, David, what shall I do? 
They wait for me in the hallway 
I'll say Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways 
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner 
I feel like a group of one, no no 
They can't do this to me 
I'm not some piece 
of teenage wildlife 
 
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes 
 
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own 
You're alone for maybe the last time 
And you breathe for a long time 
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap 
And you daren't look behind 
 
You fall to the ground 
like a leaf from the tree 
And look up one time 
at that vast blue sky 
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down 
No no, I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife 
I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife 
 
And no one will have seen 
and no one will confess 
The fingerprints will prove 
that you coudn't pass the test 
There'll be others 
on the line filing past, 
who'll whisper low 
I miss you he really had to go 
Well each to his own, he was 
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh oh oh ohh 
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh oh oh ohh 
Another piece of teenage wild... 
Wild 
Wild 
Wild 


 


TELLING LIES

 (Music Bowie Lyrics Bowie) 
 
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet 
To talk of stars and kings and feet 
Through the chromosomes of space and time 
Me I'm fast like bad infection 
Gasping for my resurrection 
Swear to me in times of war and stress 
 
CHORUS 
Telling lies, telling lies 
Telling lies, telling lies 
Telling lies 
[Ooh, ah, visionary] 
[Ooh, ah, missionary] 
Telling lies 
[Feels like something's gonna happen this year] 
Telling lies 
[Ooh, ah, visionary] 
[Ooh, ah, missionary] 
Telling lies 
[Feels like something's gonna happen this year] 
Telling lies . 
 
Shadow falls in shrinking smiles 
See me poised at the happy games 
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure 
Come straggling in your tattered remnants 
You'll come to me in tears and rain 
I'm your future, 
I'm tomorrow, I'm the end 


 


THE BEWLAY BROTHERS

 
 
And so the story goes 
they wore the clothes 
They said the things 
to make it seem improbable 
The whale of a lie 
like they hope it was 
And the Goodmen of Tomorrow 
Had their feet in the wallow 
And their heads of Brawn 
were nicer shorn 
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust 
And the world was asleep 
to our latent fuss 
Sighing, the swirl through the streets 
Like the crust of the sun 
The Bewlay Brothers 
In our Wings that Bark 
Flashing teeth of Brass 
Standing tall in the dark 
Oh, And we were Gone 
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men 
We were so turned on 
By your lack of conclusions 
 
I was Stone and he was Wax 
So he could scream, 
and still relax, unbelievable 
And we frightened the small children away 
And our talk was old 
and dust would flow 
Thru our veins and Lo! 
it was midnight 
Back o' the kitchen door 
Like the grim face 
on the Cathedral floor 
And the solid book we wrote 
Cannot be found today 
 
And it was Stalking time 
for the Moonboys 
The Bewlay Brothers 
With our backs on the arch 
In the Devil may be here 
But He can't sing about that 
Oh, And we were Gone 
Real Cool Traders 
We were so Turned On 
You thought we were Fakers 
 
Now the dress is hung, 
the ticket pawned 
The Factor Max that proved the fact 
Is melted down 
And woven on the edging of my pillow 
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks 
He could be dead, He could be not 
He could be You 
He's Camelian, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature 
 Shooting up Pie in the Sky 
The Bewlay Brothers 
In the feeble and the Bad 
The Bewlay Brothers 
In the Blessed and Cold 
In the Crutch hungry Dark 
Was where we flayed our Mark 
Oh, and we were Gone 
Kings of Oblivion 
We were so Turned On 
In the Mind Warp Pavilion 
 
Lay me place and bake me Pie 
I'm starving for me Gravy 
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked 
I might just slip away 
Just for the Day, Hey! 
Please come Away, Hey! (repeat ad inf.) 


 


THE DIARY OF NATHAN ADLER

 

 


THE DREAMERS

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Black eyed ravens 
They spiral down 
They tilt his head back 
To the flame filled sunset 
Rise their guns high 
As the darken falls 
These are the days, boys 
 
Shallow man 
Shallow man 
Eats in the doorways 
With his head inclined 
And he's always in decline 
No one heals anymore 
So he shrinks as they ride 
Under vermillion sky 
 
So it goes 
Just a searcher 
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers 
 
Shallow man 
Shallow man 
Speaks to the shadows 
Moves his trembling hands 
And he's always a little late 
For the dawning of the day 
 
So it goes 
Just a searcher 
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers 
 
CHORUS 


 


THE HEART'S FILTHY LESSON

 THE HEART'S FILTHY 
LESSON 
(Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/ Kizilcay/Campbell Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
There's always the Diamond friendly 
Sitting in the Laugh Motel 
The Heart's filthy lesson 
With her hundred miles to hell 
 
Oh, Ramona if there was only something between us 
If there was only something between us 
Other than our clothes 
Something in our skies 
Something in our skies 
Something in our blood 
Something in our skies 
Paddy, Paddy 
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes? 
 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
Heart's filthy lesson 
Heart's filthy lesson 
Falls upon deaf ears 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
Heart's filthy lesson 
Heart's filthy lesson 
Falls upon deaf ears 
Falls upon dead ears 
 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future (x2) 
And these cerulean skies 
Something in our skies (x2) 
Something in our blood 
Something in our skies 
 
Paddy, Paddy? 
Paddy oh Paddy, 
I think I've lost my way 
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson) 
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave 
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson) 
I'm already (x3) 
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson) 
Will you carry me? 
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way 
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss (2) 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
 
Tell the others 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
Paddy, 
What a fantastic death abyss 
Tell the others 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
Paddy, 
what a fantasic death abyss 
(Heart's filthy lesson) 
It's the Heart's filthy lesson 
Tell the others 


 


THE JEAN GENIE

 
 
A small Jean Genie 
snuck off to the city 
Strung out on lasers 
and slash back blazers 
Ate all your razors 
while pulling the waiters 
Talking bout Monroe 
and walking on Snow White 19 
New York's a go go 19 
and everything tastes right 
Poor little Greenie 
 
CHORUS 
The Jean Genie lives on his back 
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks 
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls 
Jean Genie let yourself go! 
 
Sits like a man 
but he smiles like a reptile 
She loves him, she loves him but 
just for a short while 
She'll scratch in the sand, 
won't let go his hand 
He says he's a beautician 
and sells you nutrition 
And keeps all your dead hair 
for making up underwear 
Poor little Greenie 
 
CHORUS 
 
He's so simple minded 
he can't drive his module 
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule 
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved 
 
CHORUS (x2) 


 


THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO

 (Music Bowie/Gabrels/Plati Lyrics Bowie) 
 
What have you been doing to yourself 
It's the last thing you should do 
Nobody laughs any more 
It's the worst thing you can do 
Save the last dance for me 
Catch the last bus with me 
Give the last kiss to me 
It's the safest thing to do 
 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
 


 


THE LITTLE BOMBARDIER

 
 
War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
 
Spent his time in the picture 
house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longinly 
At the ice cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie s days 
 
 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his life was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coins he made 
Then two gentlemen called him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we ll get sore 
We ve had blokes like you in the station 
before 
The hand of authority said no more to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear, caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 


 


THE LONELIEST GUY

 Streets damp and warm 
Empty smell metal 
Weeds between buildings 
Pictures on my hard drive 
But I'm the luckiest guy 
Not the loneliest guy 
 
Steam under floor 
Shards by the mirrors frame 
Clouds green and low 
No sign, no nothing now 
But I'm the luckiest guy 
Not the loneliest guy 
 
All the pages that have turned 
All the errors left unlearned, oh 
Well I'm the luckiest guy 
Not the loneliest guy 
In the world 
Not me 
Not me

 


THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD

 
 
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when 
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend 
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes 
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago 
 
Oh no, not me 
I never lost control 
You're face to face 
With The Man Who Sold The World 
 
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home 
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed 
 
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here 
We must have died alone, a long long time ago 
 
Who knows? not me 
We never lost control 
You're face to face 
With the Man who Sold the World 


 


THE MOTEL

 (Music & Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
For we're living 
in a safety zone 
Don't be holding back from me 
We're living from hour to hour down here 
And we'll take it when we can 
It's a kind of living which recognises 
The death of the odourless man 
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow 
It's not Eden but it's no sham 
 
There is no hell 
There is no shame 
There is no hell 
Like an old hell 
There is no hell 
And it's lights up, boys 
Lights up boys 
 
Explosion falls upon deaf ears 
While we're swimming in a sea of sham 
Living in the shadow of vanity 
A complex fashion for a simple man 
 
And there is no hell 
And there is no shame 
And there is no hell 
Like an old hell 
There is no hell 
 
And the silence flies 
on its brief flight 
A razor sharp crap shoot affair 
And we light up our lives 
And there's no more of me exploding you 
Re exposing you 
Like everybody do 
Re exploding you 
I don't know what to use 
Make somebody move 
Me exploding 
Me exploding you 


 


THE PRETTIEST STAR

 
 
Cold fire, you've got everything 
but cold fire 
You will be my rest and peace child 
I moved up to take a place near you 
 
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired 
It's a trick to make you see wide 
It can all but break your heart in pieces 
 
CHORUS 
Staying back in your memory 
Are the movies in the past 
How you moved is all it takes 
To sing a song of when I loved 
The Prettiest Star 
 
One day though it might 
as well be someday 
You and I will rise up all the way 
All because of what you are 
The Prettiest Star 
 
CHORUS 
 
One day though it might 
as well be someday 
You and I will rise up all the way 
All because of what you are 
The Prettiest Star 


 


THE PRETTY THINGS ARE GOING TO HELL

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
What to do? 
What to say? 
What to wear on a sunny day? 
Who the phone? 
Who to fight? 
Who to dance with on a sunday night? 
 
I'm reaching the very edge you know 
Reaching the very edge 
I'm going to the other side this time 
Reaching the very edge 
 
CHORUS 
You're still breathing but you don't know why 
Life's a bit and sometimes you die 
You're still breathing but you just can't tell 
Don't hold your breath 
But the pretty things are going to hell 
 
I am a drug, I am a dragon 
I am your best jazz you ever seen 
I am the dragon, I am the sky 
I am the blood at the corner of your eye 
I found the secrets I found gold 
I find you out before you grow old 
I find you out before you grow old 
 
 
What is eternal? What is damned? 
What is clay and what is sand? 
Who to diss? Who to trust? 
Who to listen to? Who to suss? 
 
I'm reaching the very edge you know 
I'm reaching the very edge 
I'm going to the other side this time 
I'm reaching the very edge 
 
CHORUS 
 
 
I am the dragon, I am the drug 
I am your best jazz you've ever heard 
I am the dragon, I'm the sky 
I am the blood at the corner of your eye 
I found the secrets I found gold 
I found you out before you grow old 
I found you out before you grow old 
The pretty things are going to hell 
They wore it out but they wore it well 


 


THE SUPERMEN

 
 
When all the world was very young 
And mountain magic heavy hung 
The supermen would walk in file 
Guardians of a loveless isle 
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives 
 
Could heave nor sigh 
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life 
 
Strange games they would play then 
No death for the perfect men 
Life rolls into one for them 
So softly a supergod cries 
 
Where all were minds in uni thought 
Power weird by mystics taught 
No pain, no joy, no power too great 
Colossal strength to grasp a fate 
Where sad eyed mermen tossed in slumbers 
 
 
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold 
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die 
To turn to mold. 
 
Far out in the red sky 
Far out from the sad eyes 
Strange, mad celebration 
So softly a supergod cries 
 
Far out in the red sky 
Far out from the sad eyes 
Strange, mad celebration 
So softly a supergod dies 


 


THE WEDDING SONG

 
 
These are silver wings 
These are golden eyes 
These are floating clouds 
Angel for life 
 
Dreaming alone and I feel that someone 
Listens to me 
Angel for life 
 
These are silver wings 
These are golden eyes 
These are floating clouds 
Angel for life 
 
Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown 
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should 
I'm gonna change my ways 
Angel for life 
 
Of all the saints alive 
Don't I feel like a saint alive 
She's not mine for eternity 
Though I'll never fly so high 
I'm smiling 
 
I believe in magic 
Angel for life 


 


THE WIDTH OF A CIRCLE

 
 
In the corner of the morning in the past 
I would sit and blame the master first and last 
All the roads were straight and narrow 
And the prayers were small and yellow 
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast 
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree. 
 
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me 
 
Well, I said hello and I said hello 
And I asked Why not? and I replied I don't know 
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be 
 
And he laughed insane and quipped KAHLIL GIBRAN 
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through 
For I realized that God's a young man too 
 
 
So I said So long and I waved Bye bye 
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind 
 
Got laid by a young bordello 
I was vaguely half asleep 
For which my reputation swept back home in drag 
 
And the moral of this magic spell 
Negotiates my hide 
When God did take my logic for a ride 
(Riding along) 
 
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips 
And showed me the leather belt round his hips 
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame 
He said You'll never go down to the Gods again 
(Turn around,go back!) 
 
He struck the ground a cavern appeared 
And I smelt the burning pit of fear 
We crashed a thousand yards below 
I said Do it again, do it again 
(Turn around,go back!) 
 
His nebulous body swayed above 
His tongue swollen with devil's love 
The snake and I, a venom high 
I said Do it again, do it again 
(Turn around, go back!) 
 
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply 
 
And I was seething, breathing deeply 
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed 
 
Waiting for you 


 


THE WILD EYED BOY FROM FREECLOUD

 
 
Solemn faced 
The village settles down 
Undetected by the stars 
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep 
And the last thing on his mind 
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned 
'Neath the covered wooden shaft 
Folds the rope 
Into its bag 
Blows his pipe of smolders 
Blankets smoke into the room 
And the day will end for some 
As the night begins for one 
 
Staring through the message in his eyes 
Lies a solitary son 
From the mountain called Freecloud 
Where the eagle dare not fly 
And the patience in his sigh 
Gives no indication 
For the townsmen to decide 
So the village Dreadful yawns 
Pronouncing gross diversion 
As the label for the dog 
Oh It's the madness in his eyes 
As he breaks the night to cry: 
 
 It's really Me 
Really You 
And really Me 
It's so hard for us to really be 
Really You 
And really Me 
You'll lose me though I'm always 
really free 
 
And the mountain moved its eyes 
To the world of realize 
Where the snow had saved a place 
For the Wild Eyed Boy 
from Freecloud 
 
And the village Dreadful cried 
As the rope began to rise 
For the smile stayed on the face 
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
from Freecloud 
And the women once proud 
Clutched the heart of the crowd 
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand 
 
And the Magic in the stare 
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said 
 Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down 
But the cottages fell 
Like a playing card hell 
And the tears on the face 
Of the Wise Boy 
Came tumbling down 
To the rumbling ground 
And the missionary mystic of peace/love 
Stumbled to cry among the clouds 
Kicking back the pebbles 
From the Freecloud mountain 
Track. 


 


THERE IS A HAPPY LAND

 
 
There is a happy land where only children live 
They don t have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There s a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It s a secret place and adults aren t allowed there Mr. Grownup, 
Go away sir 
Charlie Brown got s half a crown, he s gonna buy a kite 
 
Jimmy s ill with chicken pox, and Tommy s learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he s so small we don t notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
 
Mother calls, but we don t hear 
There s lots more things to do 
It s only 5 o clock, and we re not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
 
 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
 
Tommy s mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You ve had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup 


 


THIS IS NOT AMERICA

 This is not America, sha la la la la 
A little piece of you 
The little peace in me 
Will die 
[This is not a miracle] 
For this is not America 
 
Blossom fails to bloom 
This season 
Promise not to stare 
Too long 
[This is not America] 
For this is not the miracle 
 
There was a time 
A storm that blew so pure 
For this could be 
the biggest sky 
And I could have 
The faintest idea 
[For this is not America, sha la la la la, 
sha la la la la, sha la la la la 
This is not america, no, 
this is not, sha la la la la] 
 
Snowman melting 
From the inside 
Falcon spirals 
To the ground 
[This could be the biggest sky] 
So bloody red 
Tomorrow's clouds 
 
A little piece of you 
The little piece in me 
Will die 
[This could be a miracle] 
For this is not America 
There was a time 
A wind that blew so young 
For this could be 
the biggest sky 
And I could have 
the faintest idea 
[For this is not America, sha la la la]

 


THRU THESE ARCHITET'S EYES

 (Music: Bowie/Gabrels) 
Stomping along 
on this big Phillip Johnson 
Is delay just wasting my time 
Looking across at Richard Rogers 
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds 
It's difficult you see 
To give up baby 
To leave a job 
When you know 
You know the money's from day to day 
 
 
CHORUS 
All the majesty of a city landscape 
All the soaring days in our lives 
All the concrete dreams 
in my mind's eye 
All the joy I see 
Thru these architect's eyes 
 
Cold winter bleeds 
on the girders of Babel 
This stone boy watching the crawling land 
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron 
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand 
Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson 
Is delay just wasting my time 
It's difficult you see 
To give up baby 
These summer scumholes 
This goddamned starving life 
 
 
CHORUS 
 
It's difficult you see 
It's difficult you see 


 


THURSDAY'S CHILD

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
All of my life I've tried so hard 
Doing my best with what I had 
Nothing much happened all the same 
 
Something about me stood apart 
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail 
Maybe I'm born right out of my time 
Breaking my life in two 
 
 
CHORUS 
Throw me tomorrow 
Now that I've really got a chance 
Throw me tomorrow 
Everything's falling into place 
Throw me tomorrow 
Seeing my past to let it go 
Throw me tomorrow 
Only for you I don't regret 
That I was Thursday's child 
 
 
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was 
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was 
Thursday's child 
 
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep 
Shuffling days and lonesome nights 
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet 
 
 
Lucky old sun is in my sky 
Nothing prepared me for your smile 
Lighting the darkness of my soul 
Innocence in your arms 
 
CHORUS 


 


TIME

 
 
Time He's waiting in the wings 
He speaks of senseless things 
His script is you and me boys 
 
Time He flexes like a whore 
Falls wanking to the floor 
His trick is you and me, boy 
 
Time In Quaaludes and red wine 
Demanding Billy Dolls 
And other friends of mine 
Take your time 
 
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain 
Incestuous and vain, 
and many other last names 
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
 Oh God I'm still alive 
 
We should be on by now (x2) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat) 
 
You are not a victim 
You just scream with boredom 
You are not evicting time 
 
Chimes Goddamn, you're looking old 
You'll freeze and catch a cold 
'Cause you've left your coat behind 
Take your time 
 
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful 
I had so many dreams, 
I had so many breakthroughs 
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you 
dreamless 
The door to dreams was closed. 
Your park was real dreamless 
Perhaps you're smiling now, 
smiling through this darkness 
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming 
 
We should be on by now (x5) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat) 
 
Yeah, time!

 


TIME WILL CRAWL

 
 
I've never sailed on a sea 
I would not challenge a giant 
I could not take on the church 
Time will crawl 
Till the 21st century lose 
 
I know a government man 
He was as blind as the moon 
He saw the sun in the night 
He took a top gun pilot and he 
He made him fly thru a hole 
Till he grew real old 
And he never came down 
He just flew till he burst 
 
Time will crawl 
Till our mouths 
run dry 
Time will crawl 
Till our feet 
grow small 
Time will crawl 
Till our tails 
fall off 
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose 
 
I saw a black black stream 
Full of white eyed fish 
And a drowning man 
With no eyes at all 
I felt a warm warm breeze 
That melted metal and steel 
I got a bad migraine 
That lasted three long years 
And the pills that I took 
Made my fingers disappear 
 
Time will crawl, time will crawl 
Time will crawl 
Till the 21st century lose 
 
You were a talented child 
You came to live in our town 
We never bothered to scream 
When your mask came off 
We only smelt the gas 
As we lay down to sleep 
 
Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down 
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out 
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red 
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose 
 
Time will crawl 
and our mouths run dry 
Time will crawl 
and our feet grow small 
Time will crawl 
and our tails fall off 
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose 
 
Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down 
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out 
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red 
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose 
 
For the crazy child 
We'll give every life 
For the crackpot notion 


 


TIN MACHINE

 (D.Bowie/T.Sales/H.Sales/R.Gabrels) 
 
Tin machine Tin machine 
Take me anywhere 
somewhere without alcohol 
Or goons with muddy hair 
Tin machine Tin machine 
 
Tin machine Tin machine 
The zombies that I pass 
The guy that beats his baby up 
The preachers and their past 
Tin machine Tin machine Tin machine 
 
Baby doll Baby doll 
Clarity and prayer 
There's more than money 
moving here 
There's mindless maggot glare 
Working horrors humping Tories 
Spittle on their chins 
Carving up my children's future 
Read 'em pal and grin 
 
CHORUS 
Raging raging raging 
Burning in my room 
C'mon and get a good idea 
C'mon and get it soon 
I'm waiting on the fire escape 
I'm not exactly well 
I'm neither red nor black nor white 
I'm grey and blown to hell 
Tin machine Tin machine 
 
Make some new 
computer thing 
That puts me on the moon 
Not this psycho time bomb 
planet 
Poised to meet its maker 
Shake a leg 
Tin machine Tin machine 
 
One sick deathless duty 
to remain 
Endangered species 
They reach right out to touch someone 
Then wash their crusty hands 
Tin machine Tin machine 
 
Baby doll Baby doll 
Blue suede tuneless wonders 
Mass confusion faithless blues 
Night that spews out watchmen 
Mopping up another fortune 
Fractured words and branca sonic 
Anger trapped 
behind locked doors 
And right between the eyes 


 


TONIGHT

 (Bowie/Pop) 
 
I saw my baby 
She was turning blue 
I knew that soon 
Her young life was through 
And so I got down on my knees 
Down by her bed 
And these are the words 
To her I said 
 
Everything will be alright tonight 
Everything will be alright tonight 
No one moves 
No one talks 
No one thinks 
No one walks tonight 
Tonight 
Everyone will be alright tonight 
Everyone will be alright tonight 
No one moves 
No one talks 
No one thinks 
No one walks tonight 
Tonight 
 
I am gonna love you till the end 
I will love you till I reach the end 
I will love you till I die 
I will see you in the sky 
Tonight 


 


TOO DIZZY

 (Bowie/Kizilcay) 
 
There's too much talking for a night drive 
Too much mist in front of my eyes 
I'm trying not to lose control 
But you're just pushin' for a fight 
You look trapped, turn the radio on 
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone 
But I'm helpless in love with you 
But you're just looking , looking for a break 
 
CHORUS 
Is it love or is it what 
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away 
What kind of love is he giving you 
I'm a dizzy's 
what I'm trying to say 
Too Dizzy 
You can't have a lover 
Too Dizzy 
It's me and no other 
I'm a bad loser I'm a shakin' in anger 
Too Dizzy you can't have no lover 
 
2nd time: Don't come any harder 
Don't come any closer 
 
You can go on dreaming every night 
But I'm not letting you out of my sight 
I'm a ten times the man than any guy around 
But you're just itchin' twitchin' itchin' for a break 
 
There's too much talking for a night drive 
Too much mist in front of my eyes 
But I'm helpless in love with you 
But you're just looking for a break 
 
CHORUS 


 


TRY SOME, BUY SOME

 Way back in time 
Someone said try some 
I tried some 
Now buy some, I bought some... 
Oh oh oh 
After a while 
When I had tried them, denied them 
I opened my eyes and I saw you... 
 
Not a thing did I have 
Not a thing did I see 
'Till I called on your love 
And your love came to me 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh ohhh 
 
Through my life 
I've seen grey sky, met big fry 
Seen them die to get high... 
Ohhh 
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely 
I opened my eyes and I saw you 
 
Not a thing did I feel 
Not a thing did I know 
'Till I called on your love 
And your love sure did grow 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh ohhh 
 
Won't you try some 
Baby won't you buy some 
Won't you try some 
Baby won't you buy some 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh ohhh

 


TUMBLE AND TWIRL

 (Bowie/Pop) 
 
I've seen the city 
I took the next flight 
For Borneo 
They say it's pretty 
I like the tee shirts 
In Borneo 
Some wear Bob Marley 
Others in Playboy 
Or Duvalier 
Make the last plane come 
Let me rise through the cloudy above 
With a book on Borneo 
 
Strangers come and go 
It's such a waste of time 
Problems far behind 
Another day 
But even in springtime 
It's a rich slice of life 
So send me a letter 
I'll reply with a broken spear 
That dusky mulatto 
In nylons and tattoos 
Hot juice in coke bottles 
We dance in the sand 
Well, they twirl and they tumble 
 
Yes, they twirl and they tumble 
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble 
I've been to Leon's 
He's got nine daughters 
And a stereo 
They say that Leon 
Watches from the tree tops 
In Borneo 
When the road is mud 
Everything stops with a thud 
That's the way it goes down 
yonder in Borneo 
Far beneath his mansion 
There's an open drain 
Sending all the sewage down the hill 
But when the general shows movies 
No one hesitates 
To sneak from the jungle 
They laugh and they mumble 
Enjoying the show 
And that dusky mulatto 
 
Hot juice in coke bottles 
In Blue Jeans and tattoos 
Well, they twirl and they tumble 
Yes, they twirl and they tumble 
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble 
 
I like the free world 
They say it's pretty 
This time of year 
They tumble and twirl (x2) 
I'll tumble and twirl 
 
They twirl and they tumble (x2) 
 
I like the free world (x2) 
 
They say it's pretty 
 
This time of year (x2) 


 


TVC15

 
 
Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine 
I give my complete attention 
to a very good friend of mine 
He's quadraphonic, he's a, 
he's got more channels 
So hologramic,

I brought my baby home, she 
She sat around forlorn 
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she 
She crawled right in, oh my 
She crawled right in my 
So hologramic,

Oh, so demonic,

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading 
 
 Send back 
my dream test baby, 
She's my main feature 
My T V C one five, he, he just 
Stares back unblinking 
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five 
One of these nights I may just 
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby, then 
 
We'll spend some time together 
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five 
My baby's in there someplace 
Love's rating in the sky 
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five

UNCLE ARTHUR

 
 
 
Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
 
CHORUS 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
 
CHORUS 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
 
 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother 


 


UNDER PRESSURE

 Pressure pushing down on me 
Pressing down on you no man ask for 
Under pressure 
That burns a building down 
Splits a family in two 
Puts people on streets 
 
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about 
Watching some good friends 
Screaming let me out 
Pray tomorrow gets me higher 
Pressure on people 
People on the streets 
 
Chipping around 
kick my brains on the floor 
These are the days 
It never rains but it pours 
 
People on streets 
People on streets 
 
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about 
Watching some good friends 
screaming let me out 
Pray tomorrow gets me higher 
Pressure on people 
People on the streets 
 
Turned away from it all like a blind man 
Sat on a fence but it don't work 
Keep coming up with love 
but it's so slashed and torn 
Why 
Love 
Insanity laughs 
under pressure 
we're cracking 
Can't we give ourselves 
one more chance 
Why can't we give love 
that one more chance 
Why can't we give love 
 
Cause love's such an old fashioned word 
And love dares you to care 
for the people 
on the edge of the night 
And love dares to change 
our way of caring about ourselves 
This is our last dance 
This is our last dance 
This is ourselves 
Under Pressure 
Under Pressure 
Pressure

 


UNDER THE GOD

 (D.Bowie) 
 
Skin dance 
back a the condo 
Skin heads getting to school 
Beating on Blacks with a baseball bat 
Racism back in rule 
 
White trash picking up 
Nazi flags 
While you was gone, there was war 
This is the West, get used to it 
They put a swastika over the door 
 
CHORUS 
Under the God Under the God 
One step over the red line 
Under the God Under the God 
Ten steps into the crazy 
 
Washington heads in the toilet bowl 
Don't see supremicist hate 
Right wing dicks 
in their boiler suits 
Picking out who to annihilate 
 
Toxic jungle of Uzi trails 
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here 
Fascist flare is fashion cool 
Well, you're dead 
you just ain't buried (yet) 
 
CHORUS 
As the walls came tumbling down 
So, the secrets that we shared 
I believed you by the palace gates. 
Now the savage days are here 
 
Under the gods 
Crazy eyed man 
with a shot gun 
Hot headed creep with a knife 
Love and peace and harmony 
Love you could cut with a knife 


 


UNDERGROUND

No one can blame you 
For walking away 
Too much rejection 
No love injection

You'll find someone true 
(down underground) 
Down in the underground

A crystal moon, ah, ah

UNTITLED NO.1

 
 
In mornings she's so regal 
that the valley sighs 
In the chilly sea that killed her real slow 
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides 
Fill the cup 
with these sleepy souls 
 
CHORUS 
Shimi Kapoor 
It's clear that some things never take 
Shimi Kapoor 
Please, heal these tears 
Shimi Kapoor 
 
She will feel like at tea, 
make me laugh all along 
With such feats like sex 
only brought upon 
Oh lady, oh baby, 
maybe I'll live my lies alone 
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up up up ??

Please heal these tears

UNWASHED AND SOMEWHAT SLIGHTLY DAZED

 
 
Spy, spy, pretty girl 
I see you see me through your window 
Don't turn your nose up 
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last 
 
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house 
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you 
I'm the Cream 
Of the Great Utopia Dream 
And you're the gleam 
In the depths 
of your banker's spleen 
 
I'm a phallus in pigtails 
And there's blood on my nose 
And my tissue is rotting 
Where the rats chew my bones 
And my eye sockets empty 
See nothing but pain 
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day 
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed 
As I'm Unwashed 
and Somewhat Slightly Dazed 
 
I got eyes in my backside 
That see electric tomatoes 
On credit card rye bread 
There are children in washrooms 
Holding hands with a queen 
And my heads full of murders 
Where only killers scream 
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed 
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed 
 
Now you run from your window 
To the porcelain bowl 
And you're sick from your ears 
To the red parquet floor 
And the Braque on the wall 
Slides down your front 
And eats through your belly 
It's very catching 
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed 
About the strange Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed. 


 


UP THE HILL BACKWARDS

 
 
The vacuum created 
by the arrival of freedom 
And the possibilities it seems to offer 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
 
A series of shocks sneakers fall apart 
Earth keeps on rolling 
witnesses falling 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
up the hill backwards 
It'll be alright ooo ooo 
 
While we sleep they go to work 
We're legally crippled 
it's the death of love 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it 
 
More idols than realities 
I'm OK, you're so so 
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah up the hill backwards 
It'll be alright ooo ooo 


 


VELVET GOLDMINE

 You got crazy legs, 
you got amazin' head 
You got rings on your fingers 
and your hair's hot red 
You got the width of my tongue 
name on the sun 
I clutch you close to my breast 
Cause you're the only one, 
who uses school to pleasure 
You make me act real gone, 
you make me troll along 
I had to ravish your capsule, 
suck you dry 
Feel the teeth in your bones, 
heal ya head with my own 
Why if I don't have you whole, 
is that your final love? 
Here all together 
 
CHORUS 
Velvet goldmine, 
you stroke me like the rain 
Snake it, take it, 
panther princess you must stay 
Velvet goldmine, 
naked on your chain 
I'll be your king volcano right for you 
again and again 
My velvet goldmine 
You're my taste, my trip, 
I'll be your master zip 
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, 
you'll make me jump to my feet 
So you'll give me your hand, 
give me your sound 
Let my sea wash your face, 
I'm falling, I can't stand 
Oooh! Clutch your makeup! 
 
CHORUS 
Oh! Shoot you down, bang bang 
 
CHORUS 
(hum) Velvet Goldmine (repeat)

Blood on video video crime

VOYEUR OF UTTER DESTRUCTION (AS BEAUTY)

 (Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels Lyrics: Bowie) 
Turn, and turn again (x2) 
 
I shake 
And stare at the sun 
Till my eyes burn 
I shake 
At the mothers brutal vermin 
I shake 
And stare at the watery moon 
With the same desire 
As the sober Philistine 
And I shake 
(Turn and turn again) 
Worm, the pain and blade 
Turn and turn again 
 
The screw 
Is a tightening Atrocity 
I shake 
For the reeking flesh 
Is as romantic as hell 
The need 
To have seen it all 
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction 
As beauty 
I shake 
Turn and turn again 
I shake 
Turn and turn again 
I shake(x3) 
 
Research has pierced 
All extremes of my sex 
Call it a day 
Call it a day 
Needle point life 
Blinds the will to be next 
Call it a day (repeat) 
Today (repeat ad. inf) 


 


WAITING FOR THE MAN

 I'm waiting for the man 
Twenty six dollars in my hand 
Up to Lexington, One Two Five 
So sick and dirty more dead than alive 
I'm waiting for the man 
 
Hey white boy, what you doing uptown? 
Hey white boy, 
you're chasing all the women around 
Oh pardon me sir 
it's furthest from my mind 
I'm just looking 
for a good friend of mine 
I'm waiting for the man 
 
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black 
PR shoes, 
and a big straw hat 
He's never early, he's always late 
First thing you learn is 
that you've always got to wait 
I'm waiting for the man 
 
Brown stone building 
and three flights of stairs 
Nobody stops you 
'cause nobody cares 
He's got the works 
and he gives you sweet taste 
But then you've got to split 
because you've got no time to waste 
I'm waiting for the man 
 
Baby don't you holler, 
darling don't you scream and shout 
I'm feeling good, 
I'm going to work it on out 
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine 
Until tomorrow 
but that's just another time 
I'm waiting for the man 
 
I'm waiting for the man 
Twenty six dollars lying there in my hand 
Up to Lexington, One Two Five 
So sick and dirty more dead than alive 
I'm waiting for the man

WATCH THAT MAN

 
 
Shakey threw a party 
that lasted all night 
Everybody drank a lot of something nice 
There was an old fashioned band 
of married men 
Looking up to me 
for encouragement 
 it was so so 
 
The ladies looked bad 
but the music was sad 
No one took their eyes off Lorraine 
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll 
Her feathers looked better and better 
 it was so so 
 
Yea! it was time to unfreeze 
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees 
Slam! so it wasn't a game 
Cracking all the mirrors in shame 
 
CHORUS 
Watch that man!3 Oh honey, watch that man 
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and 
spoon 
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man 
He walks like a jerk 
But he's only taking care of the room 
Must be in tune 
 
A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands 
So Shakey hung him up to dry 
The pundits3were joking 
the manholes were smoking 
And every bottle battled 
with the reason why 
 
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone 
A throw back from someone's LP 
A lemon in a bag played 
the Tiger Rag3 
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding 
 
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf 
For I couldn't understand the conversation 
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information 
 
CHORUS 
 
Watch that man (repeat ad inf.) 


 


WE ARE HUNGRY MEN

 
 
(spoken) 
Here is the news 
According the latest world population survey 
The figures have reached danger point, my god 
London 15 million 75 thousand 
New York 80 million 
Paris 15 million and 30 
China 1000 million 
Billington Spa: lots 
 
My studies include suffragy 
I formed my own society 
To study the power of fecundity 
The world will overpopulate 
Unless you claim infertility 
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah 
 
CHORUS 
We are not your friends 
We don t give a damn for what you re saying 
We re here to live our lives 
I propose to give the pill 
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible 
The crops of few, the cattle gun 
There s only one way to linger on 
So who will buy a drink for me, your 
Messiah 
 
 
CHORUS 
(spoken) 
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders 
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their 
allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated 
One only cubic foot of air is 
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion 
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide 
 
CHORUS 
You don t seem to hear me clear 
Do I talk about your sphere? 
Let me explain my project dear 
Show you how I ll save the world 
Or let it die within the year 
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah 
 
CHORUS 
We are hungry men 
We don t give a damn for what you re saying 
We re here to eat you 


 


WE ARE THE DEAD

 
 
 
Something kind of hit me today 
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way 
 
People will hold us to blame 
It hit me today, it hit me today 
 
 
We re taking it hard all the time 
Why don t we pass it by? 
Just reply, you ve changed your mind 
We re fighting with the eyes of the blind 
Taking it hard, taking it hard 
 
Yet now 
We feel that we are papers, choking on you nightly 
They tell me Son, we want you, be elusive, but don t walk far 
For we re breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin 
For you re dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy 
You re just an ally of the leecher 
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck me pumps 
And your nimble dress that trails 
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails 
Because of all we ve seen, because of all we ve said 
We are the dead 
 
One thing kind of touched me today 
 
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid 
Pressing our love through the night 
 
Knowing it s right, knowing it s right 
 
 
Now I m hoping some one will care 
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared 
 
 
Trusting on the sons of our love 
That someone will care, someone will care 
 
 
But now 
We re today s scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow s double feature 
Heaven s on the pillow, its silence competes with hell 
It s a twenty four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell 
 
And the streets are full of press men 
Bent on getting hung and buried 
And the legendary curtains are drawn round Baby Bankrupt 
Who sucks you while you re sleeping 
It s the theater of financiers 
Count them, fifty round a table 
White and dressed to kill 
 
Oh caress yourself, my juicy 
For my hands have all but withered 
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs 
Because of all we ve seen, because of all we ve said 
 
We are the dead 
We are the dead 
We are the dead 


 


WE PRICK YOU

 (Music: Bowie/Eno Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
White boys falling on the fires of night 
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell) 
Flesh punks burning 
in their glue 
Revolution comes in the strangest way 
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell) 
I'd rather be inside you 
 
CHORUS 1 (twice) 
Tell the truth (x3) 
We prick you we prick you we prick you 
(You show respect even if you disagree 
You show respect) 
 
Mama can I kiss you daddy can I ***you 
(we wish you well, we wish you well) 
Innocence passed me by 
Wanna be screwing 
when the nightmare comes 
(I wish you well, I wish you well) 
Wanna come quick and die 
 
CHORUS 1 (twice) 
 
All the little rose kissed foxy girls 
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes 
Where have all the flowers gone 
All the little fragile champion boys 
Toys, toys, little black toys 
Dripping on the end of a gun 
(Even if you disagree) 
 
CHORUS 1 (twice) 
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes 
(even if you disagree, even if you disagree) 
Toys, toys, little black toys 
Wish you well, wish you well 
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes 
Wish you well, wish you well 


 


WHAT IN THE WORLD

 
 
You're just a little girl with grey eyes 
Never mind, say something 
Wait until the crowd cries 
Oh, wait until the crowd cries 
You're just a little girl with grey eyes 
 
So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room 
Something deep inside of me 
Yearning deep inside of me 
Talking through the gloom 
What in the world can you do 
What in the world can you do 
I'm in the mood for your love 
For your love 
For your love 
 
I'm just a little bit afraid of you 
Cause love won't make you cry 
But, wait 
until the crowd goes 
Oh, wait 
until the crowd goes 
I'm just a little bit afraid of you 
 
So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room 
Something deep inside of me 
Yearning deep inside of me 
Talking through the gloom 
What in the world can I do 
What in the world can I do 
I'm in the mood for your love 
For your love 
For your love 
 
Oh, what you gonna say? 
Oh, what you gonna do? 
Ah, what you gonna be? 
To the real me 
to the real me 
 
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh (repeat ad inf.) 


 


WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING?

 (Bowie/Gabrels/Grant) Grown inside a plastic box Micro thoughts and safety locks Hearts become outdated clocks Ticking in your mind CHORUS What's really happening? what tore us apart? What's really happening? What's really happening? what tore us apart? What's really happening? Now it's time to close our eyes Now it's time to say goodbye Now it's time to face the lie That we'd never cry CHORUS All the clouds are made of glass And they're slowly sinking Falling like the shattered past Were we built to last? CHORUS 


WHEN I LIVE MY DREAM

 
 
When I live my dream, I ll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We ll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
 
 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
 
Baby, I ll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I ll forgive the things you ve told me 
 
And the empty man you left behind 
It s a broken heart that dreams, it s a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I ll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
 
 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
 
 
 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I ll forget the hurt you gave 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me 
I m content to let you pass me by 
Till that day, you ll run to many other men 
But let them know it s just for now 
Tell them that I ve got a dream 
And tell them you re the starring role 
Tell them I m a dreaming kind of guy 
And I m going to make my dream 
Tell them I will live my dream 
Tell them they can laugh at me 
But don t forget your date with me 
When I live my dream 


 


WHEN THE BOYS COME MARCHING HOME

 How to make amends 
for the things they said 
The girls avoid the stormy sky 
But I and my cloudy face 
Will be gone, high tailing out of here 
Is the lights a blazing 
in their lonely town? 
I love the little cars 
at dawn 
But I and my heathen heart 
Will be lain 
upon some foreign shore 
Here's the saddest Joe 
on the corner of the town 
 Listen to the words! he cries 
I love him in his craziness, 
his tatters and his courage 
He'll thumb his nose 
at the straight and true 
 
When the boys come marching home 
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree 
When the boys come marching home 
(when the boys come marching home) 
(home, marching home) 
 
Aching for some innocence 
and peace of mind 
While the moon pulls up its net of souls 
The sun presses down 
on my brave new world 
But, in truth, i don't feel brave at all. 
Leave it all behind me 
to the townies and the wags 
The kids who never learned 
to smile 
While I and the cobbled nag 
I ride 
Stumble down 
another weary mile 
Here's to those who cluster, 
Walking through the wars 
The girls who never close 
'til dawn 
They rag upon the feeble 
And they swan around the stronger 
But their eyes are fixed 
on the edge of town 
When the boys come marching home 
They'll slide from view tiny, two by two 
When the boys come marching home 
(home, marching home) 
(home, marching home) 
When the boys come marching home 
(when the boys come marching home) 
Boys come marching home 
(home, marching home) 
(home, when the boys come marching home) 
(home, marching home) 
(home) 
(when the boys come marching home)

 


WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD TIMES GONE

 (Ray Davies) 
 
In my life I've never stopped 
to worry about a thing 
Opened up and shouted out 
and never tried to see 
Wondering if I'd done wrong 
Will this depression last for long 
 
CHORUS 
Won't you tell me 
Where have all the good times gone 
Where have all the good times gone 
Where have all the good times gone 
 
Once we had an easy ride 
and always felt the same 
Time was on our side 
and I had everything to gain 
Let it be like yesterday 
Please let me have happy days 
 
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do 
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth 
Daddy didn't have no toys 
And Mummy didn't need no boys 
 
CHORUS 
 
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play 
But let's face it things are so much easier today 
Guess you need some bringing down 
Get your feet back on the ground 
 
CHORUS

WILD IS THE WIND

 (Tiomkin/Washington) 
 
Love me, love me, love me, say you do 
Let me fly away with you 
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness 
Let the wind blow through your heart 
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind 
 
CHORUS 
You touch me, 
I hear the sound of mandolins 
You kiss me 
With your kiss my life begins 
You're spring to me, all things to me 
Don't you know, you're life itself! 
 
Like the leaf clings to the tree, 
Oh, my darling, cling to me 
For we're like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 
 
CHORUS 
 
Like the leaf clings to the tree, 
Oh, my darling, cling to me 
For we're like creatures in the wind, and wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 


 


WIN

 
 
Me, I hope that I m crazy 
I feel you driving and you re only the wheel 
Slow down, let someone love you 
Ohh, I ve never touched you since I started to feel 
If there s nothing to hide me 
Then you ve never seen me hanging naked and wired 
Somebody lied, I say it s hip 
To be alive 
 
CHORUS 
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin 
Seems you re trying not to lose 
Since I m not supposed to win 
All you ve got to do is win 
Me, I m fresh on your pages 
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud 
Life lies dumb on its heroes 
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud 
Someone like you should not be allowed 
To start any fires 
CHORUS 
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin 
Seems you re trying not to lose 
Since I m not supposed to win 
All you ve got to do is win 


 


WISHFUL BEGINNINGS

 (Music: Bowie/Eno Lyrics: Bowie) 
 
Cruising around me 
the flames burn my body 
Wishful beginnings 
Does this remind them again & again 
You're a sorry little girl 
You're a sorry little girl 
Please hide, 
for the pain must feel 
like snow 
You're a sorry little girl 
Sorry little girl 
 
Please hide from the kiss and the bite 
Shame burns 
Breathing in, breathing out 
Breathing in only doubt 
The pain must feel like snow 
I'm no longer your golden boy 
Sorry little girl 
I'm sorry little girl 
 
The pain must feel like snow 
There you go 
Cover me, cover me 
We flew on the wings 
We were deep in the dead air 
And this one will never go down 
 
We had such 
wishful beginnings 
But we lived 
unbearable lives 
I'm sorry little girl 
Sorry little girl 
So so sorry little girl 
 
The pain must feel like snow 
There you go 
There you go 


 


WITHIN YOU

 () 
 
How you turned my world, you precious thing 
You starve and near exhaust me 
Everything I've done, I've done for you 
I move the stars for no one 
You've run so long 
You've run so far 
Your eyes can be so cruel 
Just as I can be so cruel 
Though I do believe in you 
Yes I do 
Live without the sunlight 
Love without your heartbeat 
I, I can't live within you 
I can't live within you 
(sigh) 
I, I can't live within you 


 


WITHOUT YOU

 
 
Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand 
Just when the best things in life 
are gone 
I look into my eyes 
 
There's no smoke without fire 
You're exactly who I want to be with 
Without you 
What could I do 
 
And when I'm willing to call it a day 
Just when I won't take another chance 
I hold your hand 
 
There's no smoke without fire 
Woman I love you 
Without you 
What would I do 


 


WOOD JACKSON

 Jackson made twenty tapes 
in a day 
To give away 
A give away 
 
And he play 
The tunes they'd call creative 
when they're running out of names 
Heaven knows he's really torn it now 
But the names it hurt 
poor Jackson 
stopped the haters in his way 
Heaven knows he's for it 
Sha a a me! 
Hey hey 
He was never quite unsure 
but really sane 
Wants to play 
Jackson stole twenty souls in a day 
To take away 
A take away 
He takes away 
And no complaints 
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade 
Wood jackson took the beating 
every day, given out, 
passed away, another way 
Hey hey 
Just wants to play 
And how he played 
The mob they bleed and tremble 
when they're running after life 
Heaven knows he's really torn it now 
The words that killed 
Wood Jackson's friends 
were written on the wall 
Heaven knows he's for it 
 
Shame! 
Just wants to play 
It's a shame 
Shame 
It's a shame 
Wants to play 
It's a shame 
It's a shame 
Just wants to play

 


WORD ON A WING

 
 
In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life 
out of my dreams 
I don't need another change 
Still you forced away 
into my scheme of things 
 
You say we're growing, 
growing heart and soul 
In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life 
out of my dreams 
Sweet name, you're born once again for me 
Sweet name, you're born once again for me 
Oh sweet name, I call you again 
You're born once again for me 
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well 
Don't have to question everything 
in heaven or hell 
 
CHORUS 
Lord, I kneel and offer you 
my word on a wing 
And I'm trying hard to fit 
among your scheme of things 
 
It's safer than a strange land 
But I still care for myself 
And I don't stand in my own light 
Lord, lord, my prayer flies 
like a word on a wing 
 
My prayer flies 
like a word on a wing 
Does my prayer fit in 
with your scheme of things? 
 
In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life 
out of my dreams 
Sweet name, you're born once again for me 
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing 
I look twice and you're still flowing 
Just as long as I can walk 
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you 
Sweet name, you're born once again for me 
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things 
 
Ooh, ready to shape 
the scheme of things (5 times) 
 
CHORUS 


 


WORKING CLASS HERO

 (J.Lennon) 
 
As soon as you're born 
they make you feel small 
By giving you no time instead of it all 
Till the pain is so big 
you feel nothing at all 
A working class hero is something to be 
 
They hurt you at home 
and they hit you at school 
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool 
Till you're so fucking crazy 
you can follow their rules 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
 
When they've tortured 
and scared you for 20 odd years 
Then they expect you 
to pick a career 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
 
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free 
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see 
A working class hero is something to be 
A working class hero is something to be 
 
There's room at the top 
they are telling you still 
But first you must learn 
how to smile as you kill 
If you want to be like the folks on the hill 
 
A working class hero is something to be 
If you want to be a hero just follow me 
If you want to be a hero well just follow me 


 


YASSASSIN

 CHORUS 
 Yassassin I'm not a moody guy 
 Yassassin I walk without a sound 
 Yassassin Just a working man, no judge of men 
 Yassassin But such a life I've never known 
 
We came from the farmlands 
To live in this city 
We walked proud and lustful 
In this resonant world 
You want to fight 
But I don't want to leave 
Or drift away 
 
CHORUS 
 
Look at this no second glances 
Look at this no value of love 
Look at this just sun and steel 
Look at this then look at us 
 
If there's someone in charge 
Then listen to me 
Don't say nothing's wrong 
'Cause I've got a love 
And she's afeared 
You want to fight 
But I don't want to leave 
Or drift away 
 
CHORUS 
 
Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin

YOU BELONG IN ROCK 'N' ROLL

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Just the twinkling lights of heaven 
Two reflections on the sparkling water 
Hand in hand in love with love 
uh huh 
I love the cheap things that you say a say 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
Well so do I 
I love how she moves me 
It makes me feel alright, 
alright, alright, alright 
 
I'm a hurt, I'm a hurt, 
I'm a hurting 
I'm a man with a beat in my pocket 
I'm going down to the rhythm of love 
I love the bad luck that you bring 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
Well so do I 
Alone on a mean street 
It makes me feel on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire... 
On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire 
 
I love the cheap street in your walk, 
uh huh 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
You belong in rock 'n roll 
Well so do I 
I love how she moves me 
It makes me feel alright, alright, alright, 
alright, alright... 
Oh oh! 


 


YOU CAN'T TALK

 (Bowie/Gabrels/H. Sales/T. Sales) 
 
Beauty shrieks Beast in booties 
Coming home so lay the table 
Look at you calling shots 
Call you over under out 
 
I was under, backwards, forwards 
Holding hands in the dark 
Kissing some, kissing cousins 
Kissing this 
 
Over under out 
Over under out 
Over under out 
 
CHORUS 
You can't talk 
You can't see me drowning 
You can't talk 
I don't see you swimming 
You can't talk 
You want go your way 
You can't talk 
I know you don't love me 
 
Look at this heart's a poppin' 
Guess it's over 
Crazy action 
mine's a breakin' 
Guess it's over 
(Here we go) 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh oh oh 
 
Beauty shrieks 'Beast in booties' 
Coming home so lay the table 
Look at you calling shots 
Call you over under out

Holding hands in the dark 
Kissing some, kissing cousins 
Kissing this 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
 
You can't talk (twice) 
 
I know you don't love me (repeat ad inf) 


 


YOU'VE BEEN AROUND

 (Bowie/Gabrels) 
 
Where's the pain in the violent night? 
I'm depressed by the grin 
I stay over many years 
I should have thought of that 
For the love of the money 
Like a black hearted violin 
It's the nature of being 
 
It's too many lonely nights 
I can't tell bad from wrong 
I can't pass you by 
Too exchanging 
You've been around 
But you've changed me 
 
Where the flesh meets the spirit world 
Where the traffic is thin 
I slip from a vacant view 
I should have thought of that 
And the sound of tomorrow 
Like a black hearted vile thing 
Like the silence of tension 
It's too many lonely nights 
I can't tell good from bad 
I can't pass you by 
Too exchanging 
You've been around 
But you've changed me 
You've been around 
Can't pass you by 
You've been around 
But you've changed me 
Ch ch ch ch ch ch change! 
Too exchanging 
You've been around 
but you've changed me 
You've been around 
can't pass you by 


 


YOU'VE GOT THE HABIT OF LEAVING

 You've got a habit of leaving me 
And you've got a habit of deserting me 
Sometimes I cry 
Sometimes I'm so sad 
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad 
You could go on if you wanted to, 
wanted to, wanted to 
Wanted to 
Oh 
If you wanted to, yeah 
Oh huh 
You've got a habit of leaving me 
And you've got a habit of deserting me 
Sometimes I cry 
Sometimes I'm so sad 
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad 
You could go on if you wanted to, 
wanted, wanted to 
Wanted to, ooh yeah, yeah 
Oh, if you wanted to 
If you wanted to, yeah, yeah 
Wanted to

 


YOUNG AMERICANS

 
They pulled in just behind the bridge 
He lays her down, he frowns 
 Gee my life s a funny thing, am I 
still too young? 
He kissed her then and there 
She took his ring, took his babies 
It took him minutes, took her nowhere 
Heaven knows, she d have taken anything, but 
 
CHORUS (She) 
All night 
She wants the young American 
Young American, young American, she wants the young American 
All right 
She wants the young American 
 
Scanning life through the picture 
window 
She finds the slinky vagabond 
He coughs as he passes her Ford 
Mustang, but 
Heaven forbid, she ll take anything 
But the freak, and his type, all for 
nothing 
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but 
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song 
She cries Where have all Papa s heroes gone? 
 
 
CHORUS (She) 
All the way from Washington 
Her bread winner begs off the bathroom floor 
We live for just these twenty years 
Do we have to die for the fifty more? 
 
 
CHORUS (HE) 
All night 
He wants the young American 
Young American, young American, 
he wants the young American 
All right 
He wants the young American 
 
 
Do you remember, your President Nixon? 
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay? 
Or even yesterday? 
Have been the un American? 
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 
 bout Leather, leather everywhere, and 
Not a myth left from the ghetto 
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor 
In case, just in case of depression? 
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors 
Blushing at all the afro Sheeners 
Ain t that close to love? 
Well, ain t that poster love? 
Well, it ain t that Barbie doll 
Her hearts have been broken just like you 
 
CHORUS (YOU) 
All night 
You want the young American 
Young American, young American, you want the young American 
All right 
You want the young American 
 
You ain t a pimp and you ain t a hustler 
A pimp s got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler 
Black s got respect, and white s got his soul train 
Mama s got cramps, and look at your hands ache 
(I heard the news today, oh boy) 
I got a suite and you got defeat 
Ain t there a man who can say no more? 
And, ain t there a woman I can 
sock on the jaw? 
And, ain t there a child I can hold without judging? 
Ain t there a pen that will write before they die? 
Ain t you proud that you ve still got faces? 
Ain t there one damn song that can make me 
break down and cry? 
 
 
CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib) 
All night 
I want the young American 
Young American, young American, I want the young American 
All right 
I want the young American 


 


ZEROES

 
 
[Ladies and Gentlemen 
[Tonight, yes, the Zeroes will be singing for you!] 
 
Yeah Yeah (x4) 
 
You've arrived in the land 
of a thousand different names 
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames 
Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels 
And a toothless past is asking you 
how it feels 
And me my little red Corvette 
has driven by 
My fair weather heart has fallen in 
My rainy day girl 
is feeling down 
 
And she tells me 
that the world is spinning round 
I say the dream was all for you 
You're nobody else 
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you 
 
Yeah Yeah 
Yeah 
 
Hi, can I walk you home 
again today 
Gotta get forgive and forget hey hey 
Something good is happening I don't know what it is 
Don't you know we're back on trial again today 
 
And it's breaking wine for you 
Hell it's only 'cause you're true 
Someone outtimed my heart 
Stopping and preaching 
and letting love in 
You are my moon, you are my sun 
Heaven knows what you are 
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you 
Yes they were 
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you 
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you 
 
Doesn't matter what you try to do 
Doesn't matter what you try to do 
Doesn't matter where you try to go 
Doesn't matter who we really are 


 


ZIGGY STARDUST

 
 
Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Wierd and Gilly, 
The Spiders from Mars. 
He played it left hand, but made it too far, 
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy s Band. 
 
 
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo 
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick em by smiling 
He could leave me to hang 
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan. 
 
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls 
Just the beer light to guide us, 
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands ? 
 
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were Voodoo 
The kids was just crass, he was the naz 
With God given ass 
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar. 
 
 
Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind 
Like a leper messiah 
When the kids had killed the rnan I had to break up the band
